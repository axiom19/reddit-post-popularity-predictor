15fpsf5,"Megathread: Trump Indicted on Third Set of Charges, This Time Related to the January 6th Attack and Associated Efforts to Overturn the 2020 Presidential Election","On Tuesday, former president and current frontrunner for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination Donald Trump was indicted by a federal grand jury in Washington, D.C. [Source: Associated Press](<https://apnews.com/article/trump-indicted-jan-6-investigation-special-counsel-debb59bb7a4d9f93f7e2dace01feccdc>). The charges include: Conspiracy to Defraud the United States, Conspiracy to Obstruct an Official Proceeding, Obstruction of and Attempt to Obstruct an Official Proceeding, and Conspiracy Against Rights. [You can read the full indictment for yourself here at CourtListener.](<https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.258149/gov.uscourts.dcd.258149.1.0_1.pdf>) These charges stem from one of two separate investigations into Trump being conducted by Special Counsel Jack Smith for the US Department of Justice. The first investigation is into the apparent mishandling of highly classified documents after Trump had departed office. This resulted in [37 felony charges](<https://www.npr.org/2023/06/09/1181340894/trump-indictment-classified-documents-charges>) being made public on June 9th of this year, with [3 additional, related charges](<https://www.npr.org/2023/07/29/1190953438/trump-faces-new-charges-in-classified-documents-case>) added last week. Today's charges stem from the second investigation headed by Smith, which is into the January 6th, 2021 attack on the US Capitol and associated efforts within the Trump Administration to illegally overturn Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 presidential election. The aforementioned investigations into Trump are a separate matter from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's inquiry, which in April resulted in an indictment on [34 counts of falsification of business records](<https://www.npr.org/2023/04/04/1167708172/trump-charges-hush-money-new-york-indictment>). According to Bragg, Trump was part of a scheme to catch and kill"" negative information about himself before and after the 2016 election via hush money payments made via the Trump Organization.  Still outstanding are the results of a fourth probe being conducted by Fani Willis, the District Attorney for Fulton County, Georgia.  That probe is into Trump and others' efforts to overturn Georgia's 2020 presidential election results; an announcement related to DA Willis' probe is [expected sometime later in August](https://apnews.com/article/trump-georgia-election-investigation-fani-willis-d6191037a8993d653686e679bf5e8ea5).

15rg0kf,Megathread: Trump and Others Indicted by Fulton County DA on Charges Related to the Effort to Overturn Trump's 2020 Loss in Georgia,"Today a Fulton County, Georgia grand jury indicted Donald Trump on numerous charges including racketeering, conspiracy and false statements. Also indicted were several other individuals, including but not limited to: Rudy Giuliani; Misty Hampton, Coffee County elections supervisor; David Shafer, chairman of the Georgia Republican Party. 

Specifically cited in the indictment prepared at the direction of [Fulton DA Fani Willis](<https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/14/politics/fani-willis-fulton-county-district-attorney/index.html>) was [Trump's call to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump>–Raffensperger_phone_call) in which Trump pressured Raffensperger to change the state's election results. Also cited in the indictment was the scheme to use false electors to throw Georgia's electoral votes to Trump, ([at least 8 of whom were granted immunity in Willis' investigation](<https://apnews.com/article/fulton-county-election-investigation-trump-georgia-fb5240cf854eb546b027f950646268c2))>. 

The first charge against Trump is one made under [Georgia's Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act](<https://apnews.com/article/georgia-trump-election-investigation-indictment-rico-willis-2b18a1c1ed6a4ce22b1a2ca88ea861e3>), which is significantly more expansive than its federal counterpart. Other charges against Trump include multiple counts of Solicitation of Violation of Oath by a Public Officer, Conspiracy to Commit Impersonating a Public Officer, multiple counts of Conspiracy to Commit Forgery in the First Degree, multiple counts of Conspiracy to Commit False Statements and Writings, Conspiracy to Commit Filing False Documents, Filing False Documents, and multiple counts of False Statements and Writings, all of which are felonies.

144bt2s,Megathread: Supreme Court Strikes Down Alabama District Maps as Racially Gerrmandered,"On Thursday, in a 5-4 decision, the US Supreme Court struck down Alabama's congressional maps. Republican-nominated justices Roberts and Kavanaugh joined the Court's liberal voting block in *Allen v. Milligan* to find that Alabama's seven US House districts were drawn intentionally to dilute the voting power of Black Alabamians and to order a redrawing that creates an additional Black-majority district to align with the state's 27% Black population.

1b6d89n,"Megathread: Supreme Court restores Trump to ballot, rejecting state attempts to ban him over Capitol attack",">The Supreme Court on Monday restored Donald Trump to 2024 presidential primary ballots, rejecting state attempts to hold the Republican former president accountable for the Capitol riot.
>
>The U.S. Supreme Court has unanimously reversed a Colorado supreme court ruling barring former President Donald J. Trump from its primary ballot. The opinion is a “per curiam,” meaning it is behalf of the entire court and not signed by any particular justice. However, the three liberal justices — Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson — filed their own joint opinion concurring in the judgment.

1al6iir,"We brought the 14th Amendment lawsuit that barred Trump from the CO ballot. Tomorrow, we defend that victory before the Supreme Court. Ask Us Anything.","Hi there - we’re Noah Bookbinder (President), Donald Sherman (Chief Counsel) and Nikhel Sus (Director of Strategic Litigation) with Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), a non-partisan ethics watchdog organization based in DC. Tomorrow, we will be at the Supreme Court as part of the legal team representing the voters challenging Trump's eligibility to be on the presidential primary ballot in the case Trump v. Anderson, et al. Here’s the proof: https://twitter.com/CREWcrew/status/1754958181174763641.

Donald Trump’s actions on January 6, 2021 bar him from presidential primary ballots under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment. Section 3 bars anyone from holding office if they swore an “oath . . . to support the Constitution of the United States” as a federal or state officer and then “engaged in insurrection or rebellion” against the Constitution. It was written to ensure that anyone who engages in insurrectionist activity is not eligible to join – or lead – the very government they attempted to overthrow. Trump does not need to be found guilty of an insurrection to be disqualified from holding office. 

We believe that disqualifying Trump as a presidential candidate is a matter not of partisan politics, but of Constitutional obligation. Rule of law and faith in the judicial system must be protected, and in defending the decision of the Colorado Supreme Court, we are working to defend American democracy. 

Ask us anything!

12kqi80,"In honor of Vin Diesel wearing 3 different sleeveless shirts in the Fast X trailer, I scoured his films, noting every sleeveless shirt & time spent in them. When he wears 4 sleeveless shirts & spends 14-15% of the films running time in them, the films make more money and have higher critic scores"," **So you know -** This data is meant to be cheeky and random, if you’ve read my other dumb data posts, you know that I enjoy digging into random data and writing many words about the results. 

Vin Diesel loves sleeveless shirts. He wore [sleeveless shirts while bouncing](https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2020/03/12/bloodshot-vin-diesel-talks-fast-and-furious-iconic-tank-top/5022862002/), and if you check out his 1995 [New York Toy Fair clips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4HLBfTcAUg), or his 1995 short film [Multi-Facial](https://youtu.be/A6j1yfUxB0U), you’ll see that long before he was rocking TWO sleeveless shirts at the same time in *F9*, he was all about the sleeveless life. 

While watching *F9* for another research assignment, I started wondering whether the amount of sleeveless shirts, or screen time in which Diesel wears a sleeveless shirt affect the overall quality of the movie. Thus, I went through all of his live-action films where he appears on screen (sorry Groot), pulled the minutes of sleeveless screen time, counted the shirts, and broke down the data to see if there is an optimal amount of sleeveless t-shirt wearing that Vin should adopt. Having done this before with Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise, and jet ski action scenes I felt certain that I could mine his filmography and present some incredibly random and unimportant data that might make you chuckle a bit while you read this. 

**Quick Note** \- Since I’m not a total maniac I didn’t sit there with a stopwatch and count every second of his screen time. I count the scenes that he’s in where he could appear on screen at any time. For instance, this scene in [Fast Five when he’s talking to Brian](https://www.google.com/search?q=fast+five+putting+the+team+together&rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS1001US1002&oq=Fast+Five+p&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i57j0i512l3j69i61j69i60l2.2127j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#fpstate=ive&vld=cid:d7824f02,vid:_PI11rF6trY) and Mia about putting a team together. The toughest film to crack was *Pitch Black*. Diesel’s character Riddick wears a sleeveless shirt during the duration of the film. However, he isn’t always around so I only counted scenes where his presence is felt and or he could pop up at any moment. 

Also, I didn’t count the scenes where he’s wearing a sleeveless t-shirt underneath a shirt. The arms had to be out for the world to see. 

He’s technically wearing a sleeveless shirt, but there’s a shirt covering it. No arms = No inclusion

**Fun Vin Numbers, Facts and stats**

* Overall Tomatometer Average - 47%
* Overall Rotten Tomatoes User Score - 64%
* IMDb User Score Average - 6.38 
* Worldwide Box Office Average - $335.5 million 
* \# of Fresh Movies (Tomatometer score of 60% or more) - 8 -  *Saving Private Ryan, Boiler Room, Find Me Guilty, Fast Five, Fast & Furious 6, Furious 7, The Fate of the Furious, F9*
*  If you're interested in listening to me talk about how all the data came together, [check out the podcast episode I recorded about my quest](https://www.spreaker.com/user/11106493/vin-diesel-and-his-sleeveless-shirts).

**Fun Vin, Sleeveless Shirt Facts and Stats**

* He wears a sleeveless shirt in 16 of his 23 films. 
* He averages 1.95 sleeveless shirts per film
* Percentage of Screen Time In Which He Wears a Sleeveless Shirt On Screen - 18.67%
* Total Minutes Spent Wearing Sleeveless Shirts - 503 minutes
* Average Amount of Minutes He Wears a Sleeveless Shirt in All of His Films - 21.89 minutes
* He wears a white tank top in 11 of his films
* The seven movies that feature him wearing a black shirt with no sleeves have the highest Tomatometer average with a Fresh 62% score. 
* The five movies that feature him wearing a gray button up shirt with no sleeves have the highest worldwide box office average - $808 million
* The seven movies that feature him wearing a black tank top have the highest IMDb User Score Average with a average score of 6.45 (not bad)
* When it comes to the amount of sleeveless t-shirts worn in a Vin Diesel movie, four is the best number in regards to box office and critical/audience scores. 

**Quick Note** \- In *Fast & Furious 6*, Diesel wears a white tank top and a black tank top. I counted this as two sleeveless shirts despite the fact that there are three scenes in which he wears sleeveless shirts (2 white / 1 black). I was looking for overall sleeveless shirt variation, not scenes involving sleeveless shirts.

**Here’s a look at Vin’s sleeveless T-Shirt Timeline Since 1997**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sh4l1q9pqnta1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=34922b43407c3ea2699d4635bf1fd7080002ce91

**Can anything be figured out about his career by the number of different sleeveless shirts he wears in his films?** 

* 0 - Between *Saving Private Ryan, The Pacifier, The Last Witch Hunter,* and *Billy Lyn's Long Halftime Walk* , Vin doesn't play a villain or anti-hero -  which is interesting because he mostly plays villains or anti-heroes. Also, in *Boiler Room* and *Find Me Guilty* he takes part in white-collar crime and general criminal shenanigans (not world exploding action). Also, 5 of the 7 take place between 1998 and 2007, and *Billy Lyn's* was released almost six years again. He rarely goes sleeveless, and not lately. 
* 1 - It’s been 10 years since Vin Diesel only wore one sleeveless shirt in a movie, and he went out with a bang with *Fast & Furious 6* (the most fast and furious of the franchise). It’s worth noting that his foray into gritty cop dramas and gangster films saw him wearing only one sleeveless shirt. Also, *Pitch Black* and *Riddick*, the two movies that feature the most sleeveless shirt wearing of all his movies only involve one sleeveless shirt.
* 2 - Early Vin was all about two sleeveless shirts. Between *The Fast and the Furious*, *xXx*, and *The Chronicles of Riddick,* he was all about the double. I’m thinking *Chronicles of Riddick* halted the momentum. 
* 3 - I love this fact - Vin Diesel wears three sleeveless shirts in *Fast and Furious* and *Fast Five* which are the two *Fast* movies that transitioned *The Fast & Furious* world from movies about racing and cars, to movies that blow up lots of cars while they are racing away from nuclear submarines.
* 4 - Diesel has only worn four shirts in two movies, those two movies both made over a billion at the worldwide box office. *Furious 7* and *The Fate of the Furious* made bank. 
* 5 - It makes me happy that Vin’s movies are bookended by movies (*Strays, F9*) that feature him wearing five sleeveless shirts. Also, between *xXx: Return of Xander Cage, Bloodshot*, and *F9: The Fast Saga,* the dude has gone sleeveless t-shirt crazy

**Here are some fun stats**

**Average Amount of Sleeveless Shirts He Wears in his Fresh (Tomatometer Score Above 60%) and Rotten (Tomatometer Score Below 60%)**

* Fresh - 2.14
* Rotten - 1.92

**Average Percentage of Screen Time in Which Vin is Wearing a Sleeveless Shirt in His Fresh and Rotten Films**

* Fresh - 11.29% - This is partly down to *Saving Private Ryan* (0%), *Boiler Room* (0%), and *Fast & Furious 6* (6.15%) featuring very little sleeveless t-shirt work. 
* Rotten - 22.61% - This is high because in the *Riddick* Trilogy there is a lot of sleeveless shirt work. Riddick hates sleeves.

&#x200B;

**Quick Note** \- I counted every scene involving sleeveless shirt wearing towards the percentage.

**Average Amount of Sleeveless Shirts He Wears in His Movies That Have Made More Than $500 Million at the Worldwide Box Office**

* More than $500 million - 3.14 - *Furious 7* ($1.5 billion) and *The Fate of the Furious* ($1.23 billion) feature him wearing 4 different sleeveless shirts in each film. Dom loves a variation. 
* Less than $500 million - 1.35

https://preview.redd.it/bhcaawhwqnta1.png?width=1012&format=png&auto=webp&s=d801e5ac8e42aa2fd54c37cdf9dbed249e59b30b

**Conclusion** \- When it comes to a critical and box office sweet spot, the best option for Vin is to wear 3-4 different sleeveless shirts and he needs to wear a black shirt with no sleeves and a button up gray shirt that also has no sleeves. If he does this, a huge box office is sure to follow, and the movie has a chance of being Fresh.

Also, despite the fact that he wears four different sleeveless shirts, the sleeveless screen time needs to be limited. This is why *Furious 7* and *The Fate of the Furious* work so well, because they’re like “Alright Vin, you get your sleeveless shirts, BUT, you gotta wear some sleeved shirts as well.” 

More sleeveless shirt variation + limited screen time dedicated to them = $$$$$$$

Proof of all the shirts with sleeves that Dom wears in **F7** and **F8**

Everyone else was just leaving him alone and I did the same. He sat down at the table next to me and I couldn't  help it and nicely said Hi to him and told him that I was a big fan of his work. He replied thanks and asked me what my favourite film of his was. I said The Prestige and he said that was one of his favourites as well. And then for about 15 minutes we talked in depth about The Prestige, the ending, what it was like to be directed by Nolan, what pre-production was like and his rehearsals with Nolan/Bale, what reading the script was like and how mesmerised he was in Bale's process during the filming of the movie.

13y6ght,"'Bullet Train' (2022) is an extremely entertaining and the cast shines, led by Brad Pitt at his magnetic best.","I regret not watching 'Bullet Train' in theatres because it is a movie made to be seen with an audience. It' a thriller-comedy if you will, with a healthy dose of stylish action and abundance of style. When you watch an action film these days, most times you gotta turn your brain off. But Bullet Train has a lot going on and keeps you engaged and thinking throughout. The plot takes quite a few turns and hence always remains unpredictable.

There are about 7-8 characters on the train, with different motives, & tasks. But they are all somehow connected to the 'White Death' a mysterious villain. All 8 of these characters leave a lasting impression.

Aaron-Taylor Johnson steals the show as Tangerine. His line deliveries are fantastic. Joey King is almost as good. The way she switches from cunning to innocent all the while maintaining a great British accent was terrific. Hiroyuki Sanada always adds gravitas whenever he enters the frame. Brian Tyree Henry & Andrew Koji are good as well. Fantastic actor as always. And leading this impressive cast is Brad Pitt.

What a run he is on. I think it's safe to call Brad Pitt the modern 'King of Cool' of cinema. Watch him in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, then Babylon & then Bullet Train and he just pulls off differing shades of cool so so well. He is a rare A-lister that just sheds the stardom around him to completely give in to the character as he does here to play the goofy Ladybug. His comic timing is excellent.

Bad Bunny, Zazie Beetz & Michael Shannon have cameos as well and they are effective too.

Have to give credit to David Leitch as well. The movie looks slick and stylish. Clearly there is a lot of Japanese influence in the set design and visuals which was welcome. The visuals were amazing.

The movie nails humor. Cannot recall an action movie being this funny in a while. 

The action was above average although you do expect something even better when David Leitch is involved. But thankfully, the movie used action sparingly.

I think Bullet Train is one of the most entertaining films of the 2022.

“I’m not crying…you should stop crying”

Insane cast before most of them were megastar actors with an actual good story.  Beautiful scenery as it’s 90 percent in Hawaii.  Of course Mila Kunis looks amazing.  Easily the movie that made Jason Segal a bankable actor he crushed this role.  

I mean the movie is about a dude going through a breakup and his ex happens to be on vacation right next to him while he’s trying to get his head right.  Hilarious premise.

“And if I see Van Helsing I swear I will behead him HAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHA” 

Just an all time classic film not sure why this sub needs 300 words or whatever for a post but that’s what I’m trying to do.  

If you ever wanna see why Paul Rudd is a legend watch this film.  Dude played a stoned surfer to an Oscar worthy performance

152bpwa,The Rock has to be the most overrated movie star of our time,"I seriously struggle to understand how people like him so much. I think he is one of the most boring actors in modern cinema.

Not because he's not good at what he does. He *is* good at what he does. But what he does is literally always the same thing. In *Central Intelligence*, he's The Rock. In *Tooth Fairy*, he's The Rock. In *Jumanji*, he's The Rock. In *Fast and Furious,* he's The Rock. In *Skyscraper* (ridiculous film lol), he's The Rock. For me, it's like -- seen one, seen 'em all. None of his roles are ever surprising or elevate above any of the other roles to me and I feel like anyone can predict literally everything his character is going to do in any given movie (which generally boils down to punch bad guys, make physically intimidating ""candy ass"" type comments that remind you of his WWE days, and save the day in unbelievably heroic fashion). Do audiences never get tired of it?

I can't get excited to go see a new movie he's starring in because I know he's going to give the exact same performance I've seen a dozen times before, and I dunno -- the lack of range is just not exciting to me. There are other people who kick ass and make good action films who are not nearly as limited, so I feel like it can't just be that. And I can understand why he's popular, obviously, but -- one of *the most* popular?

Obviously I think I'm one of the odd men out on this one because all his films gross like at least half a billion dollars (except for *Black Adam*, lol), so I am more than willing to just take the L on this opinion, but I'm always like...how are people actually excited to go spend their money on the same thing again and again?

What do you like about The Rock? What's your favorite film of his? Help me understand!",17686,3934,movies,0.77,1689622787.0

154qncd,What movie did Hollywood learn the exact wrong lesson from?,"For a long time, my answer for this has been ""Silence of the Lambs."" Thomas Harris' book of the same name features the excellent Clarice Starling, and the movie really did her character justice. Starling is a highly capable, professional agent, but they don't just make her character a woman in a man's body. Her femininity is something that is stressed throughout the movie, and the movie goes to great lengths to show Clarice's physical vulnerability. Scenes are repeatedly shot that emphasize how petite Jodie Foster is compared to hulking coworkers. Leering men tower over her and undermine her, or hit on her despite being in an inappropriate professional settings. Clarice, despite her youth, is excellent at navigating these constant minefields. In both the book and movie, there is an great scene where she confronts her boss for acting like a sexist jerk in order to ingratiate himself with some small town good ole boy cops. She points out that while this might help him in the moment, he is causing long term damage by signaling to all the men below him that this sort of behavior is okay.

She also doesn't (as many men in thriller/action movies) solve the case by going the rogue cowboy route, kicking in doors and smashing heads and breaking all the rules because she is a lone ranger who uses violence as her primary way of extracting information and moving the plot forward. Instead, she is methodical,  follows the evidence, and is ready to rely on the insight and expertise of others - including that of Hannibal Lector. Her struggles as a woman in a highly male field also informs her relationship with Lector. Despite being the most monstrous human being imaginable, he treats Clarice with a respect and insight that is often lacking in her male colleagues.  Lector himself is also an amazing character. Anthony Hopkins was only on screen for 16 minutes of the film's run time but absolutely dominates the film (and it rightfully earned him an Oscar). He is highly intelligent, insightful, charming, and refined in his dealings with Clarice, and that makes him all the more terrifying.

I feel like the main lesson Hollywood took away from this movie was: wow people really like depraved serial killers who torture and kill people in incredibly gruesome ways, let's lean into that!",16895,7344,movies,0.93,1689858923.0

13gjhzl,Dredd (2012) Makes Me So Mad,"Another rant about the 2012 Judge Dredd remake starring Karl Urban.

I watch this movie every couple months.  It's a tight 90min movie that does exactly what it is supposed to--grimdark, gorey action movie possibly starting the Judge Dredd franchise ~~while honoring The Raid that it was based on~~(Apparently it was not based on The Raid but a lot of people don't read the bottom edit so for the love of god stop whining about this).  Some corny moments, but the writing is solid, the action is great, and the music and effects are pretty damn good for how tiny of a budget it is.

And the fact that nothing ever came of it--that it's just a footnote in Hollywood--drives me insane.  Not every movie needs its own franchise series, but this could have been just as successful as John Wick and yet the studios said, nah, no thanks, in fact let's actively sabotage its release.

Rant over.

EDIT: so it wasn't based on the raid, just read that.  Still both good movies with similar concepts, I enjoy them both.

178qf0d,Is there an actor who has had worse luck concerning joining major IP franchises than Emilia Clarke?,"To start, I think Emilia seems like a lovely person and she's certainly a capable actress, but MY GOD does she get the shit end of the stick when it comes to her roles in major franchises.

- Game of Thrones was a TV darling for years until its trash dump final seasons, with the biggest issue cited being how horribly Clarke's character was written.

- Remember when she was cast as Sarah Connor in a Terminator movie? It's better if you don't.

- Solo: A Star Wars Story was a box office disappointment and faded into the aether. Decent enough movie, but it had its flaws, and Clarke's character was set up for a future arc that we most certainly won't be seeing.

- Finally there's her foray into the MCU in Secret Invasion, which is now commonly seen as the worst product the MCU has ever churned out, and poor Emilia's character is at the center of those criticisms due to how terribly she's written in the final episode.

Emilia Clarke is a talented actress and by all accounts a wonderful person to work with, but she just can't get ahead when it comes to her casting in big name franchises. Has anyone else had a worse run of bad luck when it comes to breaking into the A-list?",14011,3136,movies,0.89,1697407533.0

14zgoo5,"I have worked as a Background Actor, I have been ""scanned"" on multiple Productions. However I was not informed that the Productions/Studios could use my image indefinitely.","On 3 different productions over the last 2 years I have been scanned after getting into costumes.  To accomplish this Stand-Ins, Featured talent and Background actors have to wait in a fairly long line then are separately put into a large tent/booth where pictures are taken from 8 different directions each 45 degrees rotation until they have the 360 view of the actor.  Some systems use 50+ cameras in a room about the size of a TARDIS Exterior. 

I was not informed that the **studios** could use my image/likeness, indefinitely/ in perpetuity  and we (actors and stand-ins) were told that they images would be used to fill in gaps where the production had not used actors during the original scene. I was under the impression that the Post Production would use this for the VFX.  Which they absolutely could be,  but could these images be farmed out to other productions?  

I understand the logistics of gathering large sums of people is a daunting task, and it is ""bread and butter"" of small casting agencies here in the South East.  If the studios are allowed to use digital versions of actors throughout the actors life what is the benefit to the actor?   Reading NDAs/Contracts is useless when the terms are in such a language that you are in need of legal interpretation, and are more than 10 pages long. I am not a learned man in the art of legalese.  I understand studios have the cover they butts, but at some point in time it would be nice to watch the credit roll and see my name when my likeness is used. 

Here are some shots from Productions I have worked on.

A [Sample Head Shot With details blacked out](https://i.redd.it/cp779ue8aybb1.jpg)  This is what I send when applying for role as a stand-in or background actor.  


Productions can afford to pay Background, Featured Extras and Stand-Ins.  but there is a move to squeeze every last drop of money from the lowest paid base of this industry.

**Fun little side story here**.   During 2020 I had responded to an open casting call for someone with my measurements who would not mind wearing a monster costume.  pay was shy of 325 a day. which caught my eye.  Come to find out after asking around I was being measured up for ""Alternate Aquaman"" costume.    Which personally I believe was suppose to be used in the 2023 Flash movie but could never confirm.

**EDIT**  I am not out for blood here nor am I attempting to gain compensation for roles in film productions, I am actually very thankful to be on some great sets that employee some fantastic people..  I just wanted to give people like myself who are on the ground level an understanding how the studios are gaining peoples images to be used in other productions.  There is still a roll for 3D scanners to be used on set to maintain continuity and keep non stunt performers out of potential harm's way. 

**EDIT 2**  For those saying I deserve my comeuppance due to not having a lawyer read my contract, I will say that I do not have a lawyer on retainer, nor could I afford a lawyer that would have entertainment expertise. I am my own Agent, I make the calls, I pound the pavement for my work.  I have to travel 6 hours out of my state to get to the locations.  If I start questioning contracts and ask for people to clarify legal jargon then I am not going to be employed as a Stand-in or Featured Extra very long.  So you take the hits, and keep on rolling.   I also get to set between 430-500AM everyday.  on days where I was digitally scanned I do not even remember signing a waiver for those rights.   Now that being said, to me its no big deal, im not going to loose sleep over my image being used as a crowd filler infinitum.

Here's one to start the ball rolling: Activating a fire alarm pull station does not, in real life, set off sprinkler heads[1]. Apologies to all the fictional characters who have relied on this sudden downpour of water from the ceiling to throw the scene into chaos and cleverly escape or interfere with some ongoing situation.

16fuuss,The fist Kingsman film has the most unintentionally dark ending of any film I've seen.,"Villain Valentine wants to decimate the worlds population in order to save the planet. He does this by giving everyone Earth a free SIM card that once activated sends out a signal inducing 'rage', effectively making people ferociously try and kill each other. Eggsy  infiltrates his evil lair, kills Valentine, stops the apolcapyse, and proceeds to have anal sex with a Scandinavian princess. 

Happy ending, right?

Well, for a few minutes, Valentine actually does manage to set off the signal. This increases the urgency of Eggsy's mission, but also effectively means one thing: Valentine succeeded in decimating the world's population.

The film establishes through the church scene that it takes seconds for the signal to make people kill. Not minutes; seconds. This means that for those couple minutes that Valentine activated the signal:

Anyone with access to a firearm went on a shooting spree.
Anyone with access to heavy machinery, tools, or sharp objects went on a rampage.
Anyone driving a car would crash it into bystanders. 

And for the worst part; most of the victims would be children.

The film shows the signal makes Eggsy's mum try and attack her daughter with a meat cleaver. Eggsy manages to relay a message to his mum to lock her infant daughter in the bathroom before it happens, but what of the other parents who didn't get such a message? Hundreds of millions of parents, teachers, paediatricians and carers will wake from the frenzy to find that not only were the children in their care brutally attacked and killed, but that they were the ones who did it. The suicide rate after this event would be astronomical. 

By successfully activating his device, even for a few seconds, Valentine achieved his aim. The population of the earth would be decimated. The global trauma, unfathomable. For the survivors, nothing would be the same again.

Of course the film only shows a couple of public brawls, and in the second film everything is good as new. It's a fun spy action flick, which only makes this ending all the more jarring. Showing how the rage signal would have affected the world would have been an interesting bittersweet ending. Though, as Eggsy tells the dying villain at the end; 'it ain't that kind of movie, bruv.'",12301,1183,movies,0.91,1694437714.0

And anyway, it's a film about maybe the most significant event in human history.  I heard someone describe living in the post atomic world as if everyone had a gun constantly aimed at their head for the rest of eternity.

146ocuj,"Casino Royale (2006) - in the action genre, is there any other intro sequence which so effectively establishes so much about a character in so little time?","We all know *Casino Royale* is one of the great Bond films, and possibly even one of the best action films of all time, but I think it's sometimes easy to overlook how masterful that B&W opening scene is. It feels to me as a sort of ""microcosm"" of the rest of the film, and shows us many key characteristics about Craig's new incarnation of Bond, all in just a few minutes;

* Bond's situational awareness and tactical intelligence to unload the gun in the office
* Bond's capabilities as a physical brawler in the bathroom fight
* Bond's unflinching willingness to kill in cold blood to complete the mission

I can't think of another action film with an intro that does character exposition so succinctly and effectively.

Problem was, they needed an actor/actress to play a court reporter and they were already on set and filming.  So they called the local court reporter and asked her if she would do it.  She said yes, she actually transcribed the testimony in the scenes as though they were real, and at the end produced a transcript of what she had typed.

Edit to add:
Willy Wonka and The Chocolate Factory - Gene Wilder purposefully teased his hair as the movie progresses to show him becoming more and more unstable and crazier and crazier.

Willy Wonka and The Chocolate Factory - the original ending was not what ended up in the movie.  As they filmed the ending, they realized that it didn't work.  The writer was told to figure out something else, but they were due to end filming so he spent 24 hours locked in his hotel room and came out with:

Wonka: But Charlie, don't forget what happened to the man who suddenly got everything he always wanted.

But when you grow up, live a life, and go back to watch this thing...My god does Mr. Wonka hate these children. He hides it so well though with the quips and double speak. At first I thought he only did it to the parents but no, he actively goes out of his way to tell us he hates everyone. Hell, he hated Charlie too until he finally proved he was the one, redeemable kid in the world!

173v88f,Disney becoming more focused on live-action is just sad,"I find it very disappointing how Disney, one of the biggest names in animation, seems to be straying away from the very medium that made them a household name in the first place.

I mean, we all know how they just can't stop making those godforsaken live-action remakes from Cinderella to The Little Mermaid and now, were gonna have Snow White, which has faced nothing but backlash thanks to the comments of the star Rachel Zegler, and now Bambi. 

But lately, it seems that even for original projects, especially book adaptations and original shows for Disney+, they have to make it into live-action when they have good potential for animation. Whether it be Percy Jackson to The Mysterious Benedict Society to their upcoming Eragon reboot, it's always live-action. 

It's just so tiring and even soulless how, instead of creating more original animated content for their streaming platform, it's always live-action, like their movies nowadays, and it's really sad. 

Before you guys respond, I know the reason why they do this, because of viewership and money as they see more people watch live-action but that also doesn't help their case as it makes them look more soulless as the reasons come across as coming from higher-ups who only care about money and stats than creativity, thus, permeating those negative qualities into their shows.

It's pretty crushing seeing that it's like Disney wants to stray away from what made them famous because of money.",9738,1376,movies,0.87,1696866691.0

>!In an effort to jump-start his career after his superhero movie franchise dies, a psychotic actor writes, directs, and stars in a Broadway play that becomes an unlikely hit after he tries to shoots[sic] himself in the head during the premiere!<

What the fuck? Why would they include the climax of the entire film in the content description like that? 

It's not quite as egregious, but the description for Fight Club is close to a spoiler too:

>!Sick of his dead end, mundane existence, Jack encounters an intriguing stranger who alters his relationship with reality!<

Firstly, that's not his name. Secondly, priming everyone to think the film is about some kind of >!reality altering strangeness!< is majorly setting up the climactic revelation ahead of time, when there isn't any >!reality questioning!< going on for the vast majority of the film.

14k0gor,Secondhand Lions (2003) deserved to become a modern day classic,"I remember clearly when this movie came out. I felt like I would hear about it for decades to come. Fast forward to today and I haven’t seen a single person talk about, reference it, or even seen it in friend’s movie collections.

This is an unbelievable L.

The cast is led by Robert Duvall, Michael Caine, and a young Haley Joel Osment. It’s the very next project Tim McCanlies wrote after The Iron Giant.

It has every correct ingredient for a massively beloved modern day classic. But it disappeared completely and quickly.

16btq0y,What was a movie you saw that missed its own point it was trying to make?,"My go-to example is Law Abiding Citizen. I love the movie for its action sequences and just the general tone of the film.

*Spoilers*

But Gerard Butler’s whole point he was trying to get across was how the justice system was broken. And that you have to take matters into your own hands if you want justice.

Meanwhile, Jamie Foxx (as a lawyer) is trying to be a servant of the system and show Gerard that his way is the wrong way and that he will receive his own comeuppance from the system he hates if he continues this way. 

But at the end of the film, Jamie not only breaks the law to beat Gerard, but he also receives a reward for it in the form of more time with his family.

Which just proves Gerard’s point that the system *is* broken, and the only way to get stuff done is to break the law. And Jamie’s point is completely abandoned.",8861,5026,movies,0.84,1694029133.0

The fact that he basically shows up halfway through the movie and essentially weasels his way into the company just feels gross but man was he so good in it. The way it all unravels for him by doing coke with underage girls at the end just makes him even worse but feels great how it ruins him.

Cruise missiles care much less about extreme g forces, and more importantly, cruise missiles don’t need to come home after the entire Air Force of That Nation We’re Fighting has been alerted to its existence.

Secondary Question: Why couldn’t all those missiles that blew up the airstrip also blow up the SAMs?  We could send a whole squadron out to watch each other’s backs and defend from the “fifth generation fighters that we can’t say the name of even though we say the names of all the other planes” and take their time landing the bomb right where it should be if all that SAMs were gone.

Such a stupid scene, no person in that situation would listen if they had the ability to save them. That one scene alone made me dislike the whole movie even though I found the rest of the movie to be decent.

16kflms,The original Predator is honestly one of the best deconstruction movies i've ever watched,"The way this movie completely deconstructs the man of action/lone hero genre that was so popular in the 80's is downright fucking sublime. And the fact that they got Arnold, mister 80's action hero himself to play the leading role in this is just...oh it's such beautiful irony i love it so much. 

Time and time again the burly manly men get outsmarted, tricked, confused, panicked, paranoid and so on as this hunter picks them off one by one without barely any effort and it takes Arnold to, both figuratively and literally, let go of his macho bravado and rely on his wits, tactics and stealth to outsmart and finally defeat the Predator. it's deconstruction done right without making the characters themselves look like morons. Almost every thing the group of soldiers do in the movie, even if it's a mistake makes complete sense. They're not morons. They're pretty smart people, it's just that the Predator's smarter

And one last thing i love is that, even though there's a woman survivor at the end, there's zero romance. There's no victorious last kiss as the credits roll and the action hero smile, no, none of that. Instead you get this sobering helicopter ride with Dutch just blankly staring into nothing, his mind messed up and broken beyond all belief because guess what...that's what would actually happen to a survivor in this situation.

14ulqy5,Nudity Making a Comeback in Cinema? (NSFW+Spoilers),"I've noticed an interesting trend with this summer's high-profile movies. Several of them feature nude scenes (in some cases, full frontal) with A-list actors.  Examples:

Asteroid City: ScarJo goes full frontal in a ""blink and you'll miss it"" moment. This one shocked me as I don't believe I've ever seen full frontal portrayed in a PG-13 movie before. A lot of families saw this movie so I'm sure the scene raised more than a few eyebrows.

The Flash: There's a scene of Ezra Miller running around buck naked with their ass hanging out. Given all the controversy around Miller, I found this part to be in hilariously bad taste and am shocked that WB left it in the final cut. I thought it was wildly entertaining but can see why some folks would be offended.

No Hard Feelings: Jennifer Lawrence beats a bunch of people up while she's fully naked 

It looks like the trend is continuing with Oppenheimer, as media outlets are reporting that Florence Pugh goes full frontal with Cillian Murphy.

I've always thought that Hollywood has taken a really prude attitude towards showcasing nudity in films, especially over the last decade and a half.  The MPAA/studios have always been permissive when it comes to on-screen violence, but extremely conservative in terms of nudity, which is a non-sensical double-standard.

That's why, in my opinion, this influx of nudity in mainstream films feels refreshing. I think this could be a positive trend in cinema. I'd like to add that the scenes mentioned above didn't feel like they were objectifying the performer in any way.

Curious to hear the sub's thoughts on this topic. Is this a result of society becoming more okay with nudity in entertainment, Hollywood leaning more into the concept of ""sex sells"", or something else entirely?",8018,3008,movies,0.84,1688867233.0
15qcsdi,Is Bautista the best of the wrestlers turned actors group?," I just watched M. Night Shyamalan's new movie ""Knock at the cabin"". I thought the movie was kind of mediocre, but Bautista's performance stood out to me. I thought he did a great job. Compared to the Rock and Cena I think Bautista has way more range and can handle everything from comedy to more serious roles. His small scene in blade runner was awesome and I am also looking forward to seeing more of him in Dune. Cena and The Rock always seem to be playing the same character in every movie and they can be good when the movie is written with that kind of character in mind, but Bautista's acting chops IMO are a step above the others. What do you guys think of him? ",8009,1803,movies,0.89,1691966866.0

15gqcih,My 16 year old niece has ZERO knowledge about any historical events. Showed her Schindler’s List and it didn’t impact her at all. Any hard hitting movie suggestions?,"After finishing the movie all she said was that it was too long and boring. My wife and I had to explain every scene to her, and after the movie I asked her the following questions,

Q: About how many Jews were killed during the Holocaust?
A: Idk 1,000? No? Okay, 20 million???

Q: Who won the war?
A: Italy or Spain?

Seriously, what should I do to make this kid care somewhat about major historical events? I don’t know what to do anymore, her absolute ignorance is killing me.

UPDATE: 

Just to clarify for the few in this thread who are interpreting this post as me trying to force my interests down her throat, I am not. I’m simply trying to pique her interest about history to hopefully get her engaged to learn. 

With that being said we just finished DUNKIRK, and great news! SHE ENJOYED IT! 

I did have to continuously pause to explain what was happening but that was 100% okay with me because she thoroughly liked the film and even asked if I’d show her a similar one tomorrow night. 
Also yes I did use Harry Styles to bait her into watching it, and didn’t lead with “Wanna learn about WWII?”. 

Thank you all for the comments, both kind and rude. Unfortunately it seems many of you on here have experience with similar teens and I personally feel that if we use mediums they enjoy such as movies, video games, hell even TikTok, that maybe we can slowly change the tide.

UPDATE FOR CLARIFICATION:

Wow really was not expecting this post to blow up the way it did. 

It seems like a did a poor job of explaining a few things. My wife and I were not continuing pausing the films because we wanted to seem pretentious, we would only pause to explain when our niece was asking questions, which for SL, just so happened to be every scene. It was only short explanations such as,

“Why are the Jews all getting stamps?” A: To get authorization to work for Schindler. 

“Where are the trucks taking all the kids too?” A: To die.

And put yourself in the mind of my niece watching Dunkirk, do you really think she’d be able to understand every scene? Every single time an aircraft was on screen she would pause (yes, she had the remote during Dunkirk) and ask “Are those German?” 

Also about the questions I asked after the film. Many of you seem to think I was giving her a quiz to make sure she payed attention, it was nothing like that. It had been 45 minutes after the movie and she made a comment to my wife along the lines of “Why did Swindler do XYZ?” which we didn’t mock her for getting his name incorrect I just casually asked those questions.

As I worked through the franchise, even though later films share a lot of qualities from the original, I experienced the presentation of the spectacle being way more quirky. Although I do like the later films as well, I sensed that the magic of that original film was replaced by forced comedy, a lot thanks to Simon Pegg’s character.

Isn’t this a standard strategy in blockbuster movies today? Even though every plot is built on a serious task, you can’t have a too dark tone because it would make the presentation too depressive. Why is that?

Sure he is essentially playing himself but he does a great job and has a lot more natural screen charisma then the majority of musician turned actors. 

This got me thinking. What’s the greatest screen performance by somebody not primarily known for their acting? I don’t mean somebody who was accomplished in another field who then crossed over into acting with great success. For example Eddie Murphy, Arnold Schwarzenegger and The Rock where all widely successful before making the transition into actoring but now everybody associates them with their film careers before anything else. 

I mean people still primarily known for other things that have successfully dipped into acting without it ever eclipsing their day job. 

For example David Bowie and Lady Gaga have both given acclaimed acting performances but are still very much most known for their music above all else. 

I’ll start. Werner Herzog is of course one of the most famous directors of all time but he gives an unexpectedly great acting performance in Jack Reacher of all films.",7297,4004,movies,0.92,1693174315.0

Most people I know haven't seen it. And finding one who has is like finding your best friend at an event you didn't know both of you were going to.

It's a colorful, fun, emotional, and fast ride through japan. Excellently shot. With an insanemy good cast, and some pretty good pondering on the nature of unknowable forces such as luck and fate.

A mystery that just keeps going, and plot that never stops and characters that live rent free in my mind and heart.

The production value of Poor Things was phenomenal, and I would’ve never guessed that it cost a fraction of the budget of something like Wonka. And it’s not like the cast was comprised of nobodies either.  

Does it have something to do with location of the shoot/taxes? I must be missing something because for a movie like this to look so good yet cost so much less than most Hollywood films is baffling to me.",7126,1453,movies,0.91,1710257662.0

176urj0,"Jordan Peele's ""Us"" only works as a metaphor. Once you watch it a second time, it becomes silly the amount of plot holes.","There are way...way too many things about the tethered that makes *zero* sense if you think about it even a little.... or if you watch the movie a second time.

For example... the scene at the Carnival where they tried to parallel the actions of the patrons above with the tethered below, makes so little sense if you think about it.

(1) How is it that all the tethered below just happen to look like the people in the Carnival ? It's not like the people live in the Carnival. 
So what happens when a new set of patrons reach the Carnival the day after  ? Do a new set of tethered magically appear in the facility below ?

(2) How are new generations of tethered born ?
How are adult tethered brought together to reproduce, to make children who exactly mimmick the children above ?

(3) ""red"" claims that the tethered were created by scientists, but the project was abandoned.
So how was ""red"" directed to marry ""Abraham"" ?

(4) Sometimes the copies are shown mimmicking the humans and sometimes they can act independently. How is it decided when a tethered can act independently , and when they cannot ?

(5) 
The boy is shown to trick/compell his tethered into killing itself by forcing it to walk backwards into a fire.
Why aren't the others able to do this ?
In fact, since Adelade is a tethered too... then technically shouldn't Red have been able to compell her to walk off a cliff ?

(6)
How do the tethered have clothes that mimmick what people are wearing that day ?
e.g. the tethered father of Adelade gives the shirt to her childhood self  and so she is dressed exactly like the girl above. ? How? Where do the clothes come from ?

Like I get it... the tethered are supposed to mimmick the people above... but it makes no sense when you think about it. It's like it's magic.",7044,2234,movies,0.76,1697189300.0

Denise Richards and Amy Adams are both supposed to be Kirsten Dunst's fellow high school peers. However Dunst was 17 when the movie came out while Adams was 25 and Richards was *28* and god damn it shows. They look more like her teachers than her peers.

Despite this, though, all three give good performances that fit their characters (and this is coming from someone who usually finds Richards wooden) it's just that, yeah, all three do not look like they should be going to high school together because two of them obviously graduated high school years ago.

13x8g5c,I’m an idiot and I liked Dungeons and Dragons.,"I watched dungeons and dragons this evening. I tried to turn on subtitles. There was a glitch so I tried again. Another glitch. I went into the settings, and, thinking I was turning on subtitles, turned on the descriptive audio for blind people.

I didn’t realize I’d done it, I assumed the movie was narrated, like a dungeon master describing what was going on, and that the subtitles issue wasn’t a glitch, but rather that it had something to do with the movie being narrated. I thought it was an interesting choice, if a little insensitive for people hard of hearing. I know that doesn’t make sense, but I didn’t think too much about it. The subtitles were mostly for my wife, and I figured she’d be on her phone or Switch, anyway.

I watched that whole movie with the visual description audio track.I grew to love the narration. I kept thinking that the movie had great visuals, but the narration added a different element and made really good use of the dialogue breaks in the action scenes.

At one point my partner, playing on her Switch, listening to the movie, but hardly glancing at the screen, literally said, “This would be a good movie for blind people.”

I swear to god, sometimes the narrator would describe things a few seconds before or after they visually occurred on screen and I was consciously trying to analyze it from a storytelling perspective and determine why they described some things in advance and some things after they’d already happened.

At the end of the movie I kept waiting for there to be something cute in the credits about the voice actress for the dungeon master narrator, but there wasn’t. 

After the credits I got on IMDB to read trivia, expecting there to be something about the filmmaker’s unconventional choice to have an omnipresent dungeon master narrator relay what was happening on screen. There was no trivia mentioning the narrator.

I went back and realized what I’d done. I turned off the descriptive track and watched a bit, I was really disappointed. It’s still a good movie, but the narration made it so much better. 

If you liked the movie and we’re planning a rewatch, or if you are watching it for the first time, consider turning on the audio description. I really believe it made the movie better.",6794,485,movies,0.95,1685594924.0

19f5r2e,Every Netflix documentary is pretty much the same.,"I've noticed every documentary Netflix produces has the same look and feel, particularly the ones about sport. They always include;

- Typically begins with a sequence in the future then we build to where it left off. 

- Shot of the chair where the person will be interviewed empty. This is then accompanied by a shot of the subject being interviewed walking up to said chair and sitting down. Sometimes it shows them just sitting there saying nothing, trying to capture candid moments. 

- Action shots of the sport brought to an abrupt stop which is followed by a bass drop.

- The voice over quotes over the action are always the same. ""you either sink, or you swim"", ""There's only 1 winner"", ""the stakes can't be higher"", ""If you want something bad enough, you'll find a way"" etc. 

- The quick quotes of the people actually on screen are also similar. A quick shot of the interviewee followed by something like ""I have a target on my back"" or ""I'm ready as I'll ever be"". 

- Interviewers question is heard off camera, very faintly and they're barely audible. Whenever this happens it's always a philosophical question like ""What are you afraid of?"".

He had the potential for so much, but has been relegated to cameos, voice acting and crime procedural dramas. He could have done more seasons of Firefly, a green lantern live action film, or been the lead in an Uncharted or Halo ODST series, or an episode of a World War Z miniseries.

Edit: wasted potential does not necessarily mean unsuccessful. 

I understand Nathan Fillion has a very successful career, and is likely very happy with it. There is just so much I would have rather seen him in that I feel like I missed out on. And no, I don't think that it is his decision to make more seasons of Firefly or any other show, they didn't happen for a large variety of reasons, I just think that he had the potential to a very good job in those theoretical roles.",6738,5848,movies,0.87,1694541979.0

14wttcc,I watched Tenet last night. Am I just stupid or is this movie convoluted for the sake of being convoluted?,"**Maybe you've heard all of this before but it's fresh to me so it's my turn to rant on the internet.**

First let me say I have loved basically every Nolan film I've watched. And I have now seen them all with the exception of 'Following.' I usually enjoy piecing together the puzzles he creates and appreciate the imaginative and novel concepts he explores. Memento, Inception, Interstellar- all classics in my book.

However, the plot to this movie was so convoluted that it felt almost like self-parody, like they were purposely trying to make the movie difficult to understand. The opening act just completely failed to hook me in any way which made the following 30 minute sequence of constantly jumping to new locations and meeting new people who all serve as barely comprehensible exposition dumps absolutely grueling. I spent the entire first and second acts paying close attention and trying to understand what the characters are doing and why. Eventually I was so lost that I had no clue where the characters were or what they were doing so I just became very bored. At one point I was so bored I started to become a bit frustrated with how much of my free-time away from work I was spending on watching this film.

18w2o3b,Home Alone is insanely well plotted (and people need to stop taking it so seriously),"I read a tweet recently (link in comments)talking about how well plotted Home Alone is, despite the absurd premise. They're absolutely correct, pretty much all 'plot-holes people discover are either nitpicks or people taking the movie WAY too seriously)

The opening is a Chokov's Goldmine, so much is established and set up in the first 12(!) minutes. Kevin's current relationship with his family, Harry scoping out the house, things that factor into Kevin being left behind (I only caught Kevin's ticket getting thrown out during the kitchen chaos about 2 years ago).

Even small things that most people ignore with Kevin's family (like how Kevin and Buzz are away from the others so they don't see what actually started the fight, the siblings and cousins are all bickering and at each other not just Kevin), adding much more nuance than 'thHEY So MeaN tO hIM aND oNLy hIm!!!' Things are just exaggerated slightly because it's a kid's film and we need clear reasoning for Kevin wishing his family away and the plot needs to happen.

Also, 'Harry and Marv should've died' and 'There were no direct flights from Chicago to Paris in 1990' are not plot holes.

I'm sure I missed more, but Home Alone is a great mixture of genuinely well made and ridiculous and some people online need to stop taking it so seriously.",5938,978,movies,0.87,1704132980.0

Pesci is, of course, one of the patron saints of cinematic cursing, so him being limited due to the confines of a family friendly film is hilarious. You can see he so badly wants to drop F-bombs like he does in Scorsese films, but instead he sounds like Yosemite Sam throwing a fit. It just adds to the frustration and rage for his character that he can't just lose it like he usually does.

The other is the conversation between Catherine O'Hara and John Candy in the polka van. I was not surprised at all to learn that was completely improvised by those two, as it must have been like old times for the friends/""SCTV"" co-stars. The funeral story alone would be funny, but Candy's matter-of-fact, almost cheerful way of telling it, plus O'Hara's reaction, make it arguably the funniest scene in the movie.

165kczw,Actors who have performed a 10/10 performance only once in their career,"Hi.

Hope you’re doing well.

I haven’t seen every Hayden Christensen performance, but his nuanced depiction of journalist Stephen Glass in the movie Shattered Glass feels like the only time he has reached this height in performance. 

The level of confidence, defensiveness, manipulation, devotion, fear, realization, panic and anxiety Christensen displays through body language, facial expressions and delivery of dialogue is something many actors struggle with and that level of range is incredible to watch and the movie itself is fantastic as well, especially if you’re familiar with the subject matter.

Who are other actors who have performed a 10/10 performance no more than once in their career, regardless of if the rest of their career is full of mediocrity or disappointment or numerous 8 or 9 out of 10 performances?",5924,5528,movies,0.92,1693415043.0

Ones I was able to pick out:

* Allen thinking his wife is average when she’s literally Eva Mendes
* Allen’s ability to attract supermodels
* Terry shooting Derek Jeter
* Allan not knowing how to address Captain Gene
* Captain Gene’s bisexual son that he mentions in almost every conversation
* Captain Gene quoting TLC without realizing it
* Allen’s demotion from Gun —> Wood Gun —> Rape Whistle
* Allen and Terry losing their shoes any time Ershon’s men abduct them
* Allen overcoming having been a pimp named Gator
* Dirty Mike and the Boys using Allen’s car as an ""F shack"" any chance they get
* The most pleasant people in the office (Bob and Allen) pissing everyone else off
* Terry assuming that every piece of police work he does is related to some elaborate crime involving drug cartels
* Captain Gene managing his two jobs: police captain and Bed Bath & Beyond shift manager
* Allen's damaged Prius

The themes of loss, redemption, and the cyclical nature of life and death were all there, but they carried a depth that I had missed before.

15kduno,"In your opinion, what film had the most promising premise for a story only to be completely squandered and fall flat on delivery?","I'm not sure why, but this issue seems to be most prevalent in the sci-fi and horror genres. You have a really neat idea for the basis of a story, but that premise is squandered and either doesn't shine through in the final cut, or is glossed over entirely. 

I recently watched '65' staring Adam Driver and was so frustrated with it. It was unbearable. On paper, it should have been fantastic. In reality, it was a mess. 

It was a ""bad"" film by many measures (too many to list) but the thing that frustrated me the most was that it had a fantastic sci-fi premise that simply wasn't explored in any real depth, if at all. So much potential... wasted. 

A human traveller with passengers on board his ship crash lands on a mysterious planet. The atmosphere is hospitable, but it's inhabited by giant monsters and lizards. 

With most of his passengers having died in the crash, he battles to survive for a while, learning what he can about the mysterious planet. A short time later, he notices a giant astroid on a collision course with his new home, and sets about trying to repair his ship so he can leave. 

He's too late, and accepts his fate as the extinction-level asteroid collision wipes out virtually all life on the planet, including himself. 

The big reveal? It's 65 million years ago, and the planet the traveller crash landed on was Earth. The giant monsters and lizards were dinosaurs. He witnessed the extinction-level event that paved the way for life as we know it on Earth. Was he the key to our evolution? 

Imagine if humankind did not originate on Earth, and we are simply biological descendants of this traveller from a much more advanced human civilization somewhere in the galaxy. Perhaps there were other travellers... a rescue operation mounted by this man's homeworld, and a few of them decided to settle here and colonize Earth. Over millenia, their history was lost. 

Perhaps there are countless other human space-faring civilizations out there in the cosmos, and we are just another colony, cut off and unknown to the rest of humankind. We think we're alone, but we're just a small fraction of the human populous. 

There is no such reveal or build up in the film. Instead, the ""Earth"" reveal is fed to you at the start and what ensues is a poor man's Predator type romp with zero mystery or intrigue. 

It could have been a great origin of man story. Far fetched for sure, in the same way Planet of the Apes was far fetched. But a cool concept. A concept that was totally and utterly wasted. 

What other examples can you think of where a cool premise is squandered like this? What's the most egregious example of wasted potential that you can think of?",5513,5044,movies,0.92,1691394370.0

Personally, I'm going to say 'Crash' (2004), one of the worst Oscar winners of all-time and wholly underserving, especially on a night where ""Brokeback Mountain,"" ""Capote,"" ""Good Night, and Good Luck,"" and ""Munich"" were contenders. 

I was sure Capote would take the Academy Award for best picture, but no, this trite, dull, vapid take on serious societal issues like racism and sexual assault presents a weak-ass after school special approach to important topics. 

Maybe it's especially offensive that the film itself seems to look down on the viewer, supposing that everyone is prejudiced deep down. Every aspect of this film feels contrived and weirdly dismissive while simultaneously accusatory. 

It treats its subject matter with a heavy-handedness that comes across as downright smug and seems to think itself so much smarter than it really is.

[Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/oppenheimer-review-christopher-nolan-cillian-murphy-robert-downey-jr-1235539375/):

>This is a big, ballsy, serious-minded cinematic event of a type now virtually extinct from the studios. It fully embraces the contradictions of an intellectual giant who was also a deeply flawed man, his legacy complicated by his own ambivalence toward the breakthrough achievement that secured his place in the history books.

[Deadline](https://deadline.com/2023/07/oppenheimer-review-christopher-nolan-epic-thriller-atomic-bomb-frightening-brilliant-1235441243/):

>From a man who has taken us into places movies rarely go with films like Interstellar, Inception, Tenet, Memento, the Dark Knight Trilogy, and a very different but equally effective look at World War II in Dunkirk, I think it would be fair to say Oppenheimer could be Christopher Nolan’s most impressive achievement to date. I have heard it described by one person as a lot of scenes with men sitting around talking. Indeed in another interation Nolan could have turned this into a play, but this is a movie, and if there is a lot of “talking”, well he has invested in it such a signature cinematic and breathtaking sense of visual imagery that you just may be on the edge of your seat the entire time.

[Variety](https://variety.com/2023/film/reviews/oppenheimer-review-christopher-nolan-cillian-murphy-1235672159/):

>“Oppenheimer” tacks on a trendy doomsday message about how the world was destroyed by nuclear weapons. But if Oppenheimer, in his way, made the bomb all about him, by that point it’s Nolan and his movie who are doing the same thing.

[IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/oppenheimer-review)(10/10):

>A biopic in constant free fall, Oppenheimer is Christopher Nolan’s most abstract yet most exacting work, with themes of guilt writ-large through apocalyptic IMAX nightmares that grow both more enormous and more intimate as time ticks on. A disturbing, mesmerizing vision of what humanity is capable of bringing upon itself, both through its innovation, and through its capacity to justify any atrocity.

[IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/oppenheimer-review-christopher-nolan-1234885847/) (B):

>But it’s no great feat to rekindle our fear over the most abominable weapon ever designed by mankind, nor does that seem to be Nolan’s ultimate intention. Like “The Prestige” or “Interstellar” before it, “Oppenheimer” is a movie about the curse of being an emotional creature in a mathematical world. The difference here isn’t just the unparalleled scale of this movie’s tragedy, but also the unfamiliar sensation that Nolan himself is no less human than his characters.

[Total Film](https://www.gamesradar.com/oppenheimer-review/) (5/5):

>With espionage subtexts and gallows humour also interwoven, the film’s cumulative power is matched by the potency of Nolan’s questioning. Possibly the most viscerally intense experience you’ll have in a cinema this year, the Trinity test in particular arrives fraught with uncertainty. Might the test inadvertently spark the world’s end? Well, it didn’t - yet. Even as Oppenheimer grips in the moment, Nolan ensures the aftershocks of its story reverberate down the years, speaking loudly to today.

[Collider](https://collider.com/oppenheimer-movie-review/) (A):

>*Oppenheimer* is a towering achievement not just for Nolan, but for everyone involved. It is the kind of film that makes you appreciative of every aspect of filmmaking, blowing you away with how it all comes together in such a fitting fashion. Even though Nolan is honing in on talents that have brought him to where he is today, this film takes this to a whole new level of which we've never seen him before. With *Oppenheimer*, Nolan is more mature as a filmmaker than ever before, and it feels like we may just now be beginning to see what incredible work he’s truly capable of making.

[USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2023/07/19/oppenheimer-movie-review-christopher-nolan/70429410007/):

>Stylistically, “Oppenheimer” recalls Oliver Stone's ""JFK"" in the way it weaves together important history and significant side players, and while it doesn't hit the same emotional notes as Nolan's inspired ""Interstellar,"" the film succeeds as both character study and searing cautionary tale about taking science too far. Characters from yesteryear worry about nervously pushing a fateful button and setting the world on fire, although Nolan drives home the point that fiery existential threat could reignite any time now.

[Chicago Times](https://chicago.suntimes.com/movies-and-tv/2023/7/19/23800288/oppenheimer-review-movie-christopher-nolan-cillian-murphy-robert-downey-jr-emily-blunt-matt-damon)(4/4):

>Magnificent. Christopher Nolan’s three-hour historical biopic Oppenheimer is a gorgeously photographed, brilliantly acted, masterfully edited and thoroughly engrossing epic that instantly takes its place among the finest films of this decade.

[Empire](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/oppenheimer/) (5/5):

>A masterfully constructed character study from a great director operating on a whole new level. A film that you don’t merely watch, but must reckon with.

[ComicBook.com](https://ComicBook.com) (4/5):

>Trades the spectacle of Nolan's previous films for a stellar cast that turns the thrills inwards, making for what is arguably the most important film of his career.

[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/19/oppenheimer-review-nolans-atom-bomb-epic-is-flawed-but-extraordinary) (4/5):

>In the end, Nolan shows us how the US’s governing class couldn’t forgive Oppenheimer for making them lords of the universe, couldn’t tolerate being in the debt of this liberal intellectual. Oppenheimer is poignantly lost in the kaleidoscopic mass of broken glimpses: the sacrificial hero-fetish of the American century.

[Los Angeles Times:](https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2023-07-19/oppenheimer-review-christopher-nolan-cillian-murphy-robert-downey-jr)

>That might be a rare failing of this extraordinarily gripping and resonant movie, or it could be a minor mercy. Whatever you feel for Oppenheimer at movie’s end — and I felt a great deal — his tragedy may still be easier to contemplate than our own.

1brgqia,Is Black Hawk Down the best example of future stars in a single movie?,"I haven’t seen this movie in a long time but am rewatching now. In the first half hour there is Josh Hartnett, Orlando Bloom, Tom Hardy, Eric Bana, Jeremy Piven, Ewan Mcgregor, and I remember from a post before that the dad from modern family pops up eventually. I know Eric Bana was already well known in Australia and Ewan in the UK, but this cast is absolutely stacked with US stars. Were any of them already famous in the US? And if not, is there another movie that went on to ‘produce’ more stars? (Not saying their success is related to black hawk down, just that it’s the first movie before they got big in the US)

1baqits,"What ""Based on a True Story"" movie had an unfortunate or embarrassing epilogue?","**Julie and Julia** (2009) was a film described by Anthony Bourdain as ""half a good movie."" The good half sees Meryl Streep as Julia Child coming up with the recipe book that made her name, *Mastering the Art of French Cooking*. The other half of the film is about a blogger called Julie Powell, played by Amy Adams. Four decades after Julia publishes her book, Julie decides to make all 500 recipes from its pages in the space of a year. From this synopsis alone you'd gather it's a mostly light, biographical drama about the love of cooking.

However, Julie Powell released her second book the same year as the film. This book had little to do with cooking, but *everything* to do her open marriage, her affairs, and her newfound appetite for masochism. The critics were grossed out, and I don't think they greenlit a sequel movie with Amy Adams. Would have been a bit of a dramatic shift there.

Usually when they make a biopic, the subject in question has the kind courtesy to be dead. But when they're still walking around there's a chance for them to either tank their reputation or make a fool of themselves. It can be tragic, but it can also be hilarious when somebody played as a completely serious character by a professional actor wounds up becoming an enormous blowhard later in life.

Edward Teller, as seen in that Oppemheimer biopic, became a crank who insisted his pet H-bomb could have an array of uses. Like blowing up a chunk of Alaska to create a harbour, or igniting it to prevent hurricane damage. The man also had a heart attack and blamed it on Jane Fonda, because she starred in **The China Syndrome**.",5248,2411,movies,0.92,1710014111.0

Now if a movie was made today set in 2010 could the comedy be based off the change in fashion etc. I feel like my wardrobe hasn't changed that much in the last 13 years. Or maybe I'm just getting old.",4950,1179,movies,0.92,1693642357.0

The protagonist, Emily Blunt, eats shit the whole time, Josh Brolin is the asshole that's right with his calls all the time and Benicio Del Toro plays a siderole until he develops to an absolute monster in the third act. I love how this movie wins by playing out evil against more evil, I love how there is no ""justice always wins"" message, I love how it just does not hold back in portraying the wrong as the only right thing to do.

19ah737,Which actor nailed a role so hard that they're known for almost nothing else (in a good way),"On the one end of the spectrum you have the ubiquitous actors like Samuel L. Jackson who has played a supportive or supplementary role in a million movies and isn't praised too much for a specific role he played. The most notable role I associate with him is probably Pulp Fiction, but he's truly a mainstay and seems to feature in 90% of movies from the 90s and 2000s.

Other actors fill a middle ground where they appear a bit less frequently but have played notable characters in say 5-10 movies, such as Leonardo DiCaprio, Jack Nicholson, Daniel Day Lewis, Matt Damon, Matthew McConaughey.

Finally, on the other end you have actors who you associate immediately and solely with a single performance, an actor that simply is that character in your head, someone who embodied the role so well that you'd struggle to believe they aren't that person in real life. Someone who might not have the most filmography entries, but a single character has eternalized them in the hall of fame.

For me, that actor is Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn in The Lord of the Rings trilogy. I am sure he has done some amazing work outside of the LOTR franchise that I simply haven't seen, but he embodied that role in such a way that no one will be able to replicate his performance.

Jason Bateman was written so  ahead of his time, throwing down red flag after red flag that I totally missed as a teen (not unlike Juno herself I guess).  Same for Jennifer Garner, exemplifies how easy it is for a female character to be ""unlikable"" when she's incredibly reasonable and just frustrated at Jason Bateman's inability to grow up.

Allison Janney and JK Simmons are amazing parents, showing how they can disagree with their kids choices, sometimes fight, but still show up with unconditional love and support.

The last act of the movie is so beautiful, everyone watching was fully crying.

I forgot how funny this movie is, it's far too overshadowed by the rest of Disney's library. The comedic timing in this movie is impeccable and so much of it comes down to the animation and voice acting. The animation lends itself to some great slapstick that you could never do in live action and the cast is spectacular, especially Ertha Kitt. Kuzco has an amazing arc as well, with him starting out as a straight up villain only to then learn how to be compassionate towards others. I know it's gained a bit of a cult following due to memes and what not but even now I feel like it doesn't get the respect it deserves.",4765,454,movies,0.94,1700619854.0

192p9vr,Has there been a movie where more people missed the point more than Starship Troopers?,"What was supposed to be an anti-fascist anti-war (even anti-pro-war people) movie that shows what how terrible a Nazi Utopia would actually be but it seemed to completely go over the heads of the audience in 1997 (myself included).

At release people thought it was a mindless action movie with pretty people that were easy to cheer for and didn't mind that they would willingly risk their lives for higher ups who thought nothing of them. Hell the ""news"" sections were ripped right from Triumph of the Will and no one seemed to notice that.  Doogie even wore an SS uniform...

It's not just the moviegoer's fault. [The film was marketed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yh8qd0VKPAE) with Song 2 by Blur cut to fast edited action shots so it's easy to see why someone initially went wanting to turn their brains off and watch shit blow up.

Even movie critics seemed to miss the point.  [From Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starship_Troopers_(film)): Many reviewers did not interpret *Starship Troopers* as a satire and believed that its fascist themes were sincere.An editorial in *The Washington Post* described the film as pro-fascist, made, directed, and written by Nazis. Stephen Hunter said the film was ""spiritually"" and ""psychologically"" Nazi and born of a Nazi-like imagination. Hunter described it as a ""perversion"" of Erich Maria Remarque's 1929 novel, *All Quiet on the Western Front*, which portrays the physical and mental tolls of war, by glorifying the horrors of war. Others, such as *Empire*, argued that the ""constant fetishizing of weaponry"" and ""\[Aryan\] cast"", combined with the militaristic imagery in *RoboCop* and *Total Recall*, made it seem as though Verhoeven admired Heinlein's world more than he claimed.",4712,2793,movies,0.86,1704833545.0

16uv3lm,what movie jerks actually had a point?,"here are a few examples.

clubber lang from rocky 3. sure, he's an arrogant loudmouth who can't even breathe without being disrespectful but he did absolutely win the championship fair and square.

fletcher from whiplash. he may be an extremely verbally abusive asshole but he is right that some people need to be pushed beyond their capabilities to be able to achieve greatness.

mr potter from it's a wonderful life. while he is easily one of the most morally bankrupt characters in all of cinema(to the point where there's even a popular fan theory that he's supposed to represent the devil while george is meant to represent jesus), he is correct that george's father, as nice of a guy as he was, wasn't very business savvy. even george admits that he has a point.

eric matthews from saw 2. he is a dirty cop but he is absolutely right that john kramer, no matter how much he tries to justify his actions, is still a murderer. as he accurately puts it ""putting a gun to someone's head and forcing them to pull the trigger is still murder"".",4628,4433,movies,0.88,1695943033.0
1911z4b,James Marsden Has Had the Oddest Career for Someone That Hot,"I've been on a 2000's kick lately and I've been rewatching a lot of films from that time period and he's in a lot of them. Enchanted, The Notebook,  27 Dresses, Superman Returns, X Men, Hairspray etc. Dude has made a career out of playing the dashing good looking muscular white guy who either gets dumped for someone just as muscular and handsome or he's playing a mostly humorous side character. It's crazy because a an insanely handsome fit guy who looks like him who can do drama, comedy, stunts, dance and sing you'd think would have become a pretty major star. He's had a solid career, I don't think he would complain. But when you think about some of the other men who emerged around the same time like Brad Pitt, Leonardo Di Caprio, Adrien Brody, Edward Norton Orlando Bloom etc. Most of these guys went onto to become leading men in major franchises, a few of them have won Oscars. 

He's one of the few guys of his type I can think of who are mostly character actors. You bring him in when you need a classically handsome dude who subverts expectations by either being funny, an asshole, a mutant etc. He's done a lot of dramas and he's very good in them. But holy shit is he great as a comedic actor. Him being in Season 6 and 7 of 30 Rock is one of it's few saving graces. He's probably my favorite part of Dead to Me. I don't love the Sonic movies but somehow James has amazing chemistry with what I'm assuming was a dummy or tennis ball. Outside of maybe X-Men, no one's ever really tried to shove him into a major franchise. I think he got more famous at the wrong time. Had he hit it big in the late 90's or even waited a few years and become a part of the MCU, tell me you wouldn't pay to see his version of Star-Lord, I think maybe things would've planned out differently. His type from 2003 to around 2010, weren't really breaking out as much anymore. Our tastes changed a bit. I do think he could've joined the likes of the other Marvel studs like Chris Hemsworth or Chris Pratt. 

What's your favorite role of his?

Sidenote: I work in the industry and I actually know quite a few guys who have complained about this in regards to themselves. One actor I've worked with for years complained that because he looks very similar to Timothee Chalamet he mostly only got serious dramatic roles, usually as some depressed closeted gay boy who ends up killing himself. I was the first person to cast him in a comedy. It's sad how people get typecast.

Second sidenote: A lot of very genuine not at all baiting people asked 'why do you keep bringing up he's a white guy which I did all of once. But to illuminate my point: Sam Worthington, Kellan Lutz, Jai Courtney, Armie Hammer and other good looking square jawed white guys who were shoved into whatever franchise or prestigious film in an attempt to make them a thing. These are more recent examples but like I mentioned James never seems to really have had this treatment outside of X Men and he was barely in those. Hollywood loves to take their big handsome Adonis types and force them into leading man roles even if that's not really what works for them. They usually flame out very quickly. James is unique in that he's very very good looking and fits that mold but like you don't see him starring as the generic hero dude in some franchise that should've died ages ago. That's the point I'm making. ",4632,978,movies,0.9,1704660200.0
18v8qct,2023 was the hardest year of my life. What's a movie I can watch to end the year off with hope?,"Without getting too deep into things, 2023 has been the absolute hardest year of my life. I don't think I've ever experienced nor will experience such growth and change again, as it truly has been the most transformational year I've ever lived. Unfortunately, the year isn't ending the way I'd hoped it would and it's left me a little down.

With that being said, I want to end the year off on a more hopeful and optimistic note and using cinema to achieve that is probably the best way there is. Moments of sadness and hardship are fine but I need to see a film that ends on a very optimistic and feel-good note. Something that makes me happy about the future and new beginnings. To make things a bit easier, here's a list of my favorite 15 movies of all time; most of the films on here are the direct opposite of what I'm currently looking for but do give one an idea of my tastes.

16u16ol,What actor can masterfully play a hero and villain equally?,"People say there are certain actors that play characters of one moral alignment so well that when they try the other side, you just don't buy it as much.

What actors can slip into either so masterfully?

Here are a few that come to mind for me.

1) Michael Keaton

While I don't geek over his Batman portrayal like a lot of people that grew up with that movie, he plays hero with emotional baggage really well. Even in the recent Flash film, I thought he brought his A game.

Then when you look at his villain/antagonistic roster, he absolutely slayed as Vulture in the MCU and even the questionable Ray Croc in the Founder. 

2) Daniel Radcliffe

I never grew up adoring him as Harry Potter either but I know he was great. My first introduction to him was actually in Victor Frankenstein, a movie that I don't think many people saw but he played a sympathetic outcast ""freak"" incredibly well.

Then there's Now You See Me 2, which despite its other flaws, Radcliffe as a villain wasn't one of them. He wasn't in the movie much but he did come off as an incredibly douchey rich kid that you kind of rooted against more so than the main villains.

3) Rachel McAdams

In 90% of the movies I've seen her in, she's a good guy and tends to play very similar roles, particularly when it comes to romance adjacent ones.

A *stark* night and day contrast to her iconic performance as Regina George in Mean Girls. One of the b*tchiest b*tches in all of romcom history.

For me, it was Glass. Perfect storm of fails as only M Night can do. You start with my favorite film of his, Unbreakable. Fast forward 16 years, and you get Split, which at the time won me back to camp M Night. It really seemed like he might have found his footing again. When Glass was coming out, there was real hype. Perhaps this was going to be his big comeback. 

Then the movie came out, and yes for about 2/3rds it seemed like he might actually do it. Great, slow burn and buildup which as it turns out was being set up over the previous 2 movies. Then the last act happened... and then I remembered who was making the movie. Undermined not just the movie, but also the trilogy. Can't think of a bigger 3rd act letdown than that.

[https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/steven-spielberg-predicts-implosion-film-567604/](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/steven-spielberg-predicts-implosion-film-567604/)

>*Lucas and Spielberg told USC students that they are learning about the industry at an extraordinary time of upheaval, where even proven talents find it difficult to get movies into theaters. Some ideas from young filmmakers “are too fringe-y for the movies,” Spielberg said. “That’s the big danger, and* ***there’s eventually going to be an implosion — or a big meltdown. There’s going to be an implosion where three or four or maybe even a half-dozen megabudget movies are going to go crashing into the ground, and that’s going to change the paradigm.****”* 

Their predictions for the aftermath of said implosion didn't necessarily come true (yet), although they were right to predict an increasing dominance by streaming, which happened regardless of any implosion.

The way so many would-be blockbusters have been underperforming, or bombing this year seems to fit perfectly with Spielberg's prediction. His own series, Indiana Jones, ironically fell victim to the wave of red ink this year. As well as Ant-Man, The Marvels, Little Mermaid, Transformers, The Flash, Shazam, Blue Beetle, Dungeons and Dragons, Haunted Mansion, Killers of the Flower Moon, Hunger Games, Expendables, Ruby Gillman, and, debatably, Exorcist, Elemental, Fast X and Mission: Impossible.

Are we experiencing a movie industry implosion, and is there anything the industry can do to turn things around and become healthy and profitable again?",4266,1333,movies,0.88,1700373089.0
14mxgyf,"Con Air on paper is a really horrible movie. Over the top performances from Nic Cage and John Malkovich, really cheesy script, cliche action movie tropes, but it's peak 90s action movie slush and it's so damn entertaining.","Nic Cage gives one of the worst southern accents to the point it's hilarious watching him in retrospect, but it's also one of the most badass performances you're going to see. The script isn't great, but Cage's performance is so good that you instantly fall in love with Poe and they build his good guy character up well enough that you can buy this guy is willing to give up his freedom and life to help this female officer and diabetic man he met just that day. The movie also surprisingly juggles really heavy subject matters very well. The scene where Danny Trejo's character is about to sexually assault the female officer is genuinely tension filled and then the other scene where Steve Buscemi finds the little girl and you don't know for a while if he killed her not is really interesting. Overall the 80s and 90s made the best action movies and movies like this that I've seen probably 50 times  and I smile each time I watch it is proof of this.

Arnold was my action movie hero as a kid. He was in so many classics that it’s hard to pick a favorite. From Conan, to Commando, to Predator, to Total Recall, to….. Twins? He did low budget and big expensive blockbusters. Action and comedy. Some of his films had very little storyline at all and were more just a body counter (ex. Commando) while others were very complex and had great character development (Terminator 2). Or maybe… just maybe, you are able to make a case for Jingle All The Way…

17oxs13,"What's the dumbest ""fact"" about a movie someone has tried to convince you is true?","Two famous examples: 

In *The Wizard of Oz*, some people are adamant there is footage of a man hanging himself in the background of a scene. Either a munchkin or the original actor slated to play Tin Man. But even if there was a death on set, even if he did kill himself on a live soundstage, even if it did happen while the camera was rolling and nobody noticed, somebody would have found the body when they were striking the set. Somebody would have alerted the director, who would check the rushes out, and they'd realize it before the scene was edited into the final cut.

The only reason this isn't the stupidest urban legend ever is because some people believe *Three Men and a Baby* contains documented evidence that ghosts are real.

Two more personal examples:

In 2001, a friend was convinced that *Spider-Man* contained fully CGI costume and effects for both Spider-Man and Green Goblin. Not a wholly unreasonable thing for SFX houses to produce today, but in 2001? Come on.

Speaking of unnecessarily intense and unrealistic for the era special effects, another rumor perpetuated that in *Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me*, Mike Myers's face was digitally superimposed onto Verne Troyer's body for all scenes featuring Mini Me.

I think 22 jump street was the end of the comedy era in Hollywood. I maybe wrong but comedies are dead. They are mostly bad or people just don't see them. Weird because comedy or romcoms or buddy comedy movies were always so successful and boom suddenly they stopped. I miss the 2000s and early 2010s man. 

But coming back to jump street, 21 jump street is iconic. Can we call it iconic? I mean Johnny Depp's cameo is enough to call it iconic. 

"" You see this nose? This is a fake nose"". 

And Ice fucking cube. Every line he spits out is so memorable. And of course Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill have amazing chemistry. But for some reason I love 22 jump street over 21. I mean both are some of my favorite comedies of all time but something about 22 jump street I keep going back to it. The opening scene. "" My name's Jeff"" has become a pop culture reference over the years. The one Ice Cube scene in the restaurant. Fuck. And the slam poetry scene lmaoo.

17otgh9,Rush Hour 1 and 2 are top tier action comedies. Timeless classics. The ones we need right now,"There is something about the Rush Hour sequels. I keep going back to it and I never grow bored of it at all. And I know for a fact it's not just me. It's a fucking fan favorite. 

Impeccable chemistry between Jackie and Chris Tucker, well choreographed action, top tier comedy. What else does an action comedy even need? And on top of all this the bloopers. The fucking Rush Hour bloopers man. That's a different genre by itself. Before we talk about the movie how was the theatrical experience when the movie came out? I can only imagine the audience losing it whenever Jackie and Tucker are on screen. 

Both Rush hour 1 and 2 are perfect at what they offer. I mean fuck I may even like the second one over the first because Jackie and Tucker' chemistry is absolutely beautiful to say the least. And Rush Hour 2 has some amazing action set pieces too. And who can forget the detective Yu dialogue exchange. It's poetry. And Don Cheadle's cameo is iconic. But if we're talking iconic dialogues Rush hour 1 probably takes the point. Actually you know what I don't even know because Rush hour 2 has this dialogue :

"" I'll Slap You So Hard, You'll End Up In The Ming Dynasty"" or 

"" When was the last time you had a date? Year of the rat?"" and 

"" I can’t believe I flew 10,000 miles for this shit"" 

"" Do you understand the words that are a-coming out of my mouth"". "" Don’t nobody understand the words that are comin’ out of your mouth.""

Fuck I can keep going on though. That's how iconic and memorable the two movies are and I miss these type movies so much man. Let's not talk about the third one though. It was forgettable and boring except for a few jokes here and there, mainly the Yu joke that somehow works everytime.

1baj5lj,"Actors who play very ""masculine"" roles but are the opposite in real life or interviews.","I've been watching those Iconic Character videos lately and noticing a real pattern of some of the actors whom I would consider ""masculine""  really come across as a sort of delicate artist type in the interview.    (Also this is not supposed to be shaming anything)     Three that come to mind are Sean Penn,   Kurt Russel and Sylvester Stallone.

Sean Penn really threw me for a loop.     He seems like  Martin Short in the interview.   Not at all what I imagined over the decades.

The first thing that comes to mind is what the parties must be like in Hollywood when you walk in a room with all these tough guys and it feels like you are hanging out at an Art Gallery opening.

16ysv75,"What ""ambiguous"" endings never felt ambiguous to you?","Many movies do ambiguous endings where they leave a question open-ended. However, sometimes a mystery that is meant to be ambiguous seems clear to people who apply their own logic.

One of the most famous ambiguous endings is how the Director's Cut of Blade Runner implies that Deckard may be a Replicant, but doesn't make it explicit, even the sequel refuses to confirm it. However, to me Deckard couldn't possibly be a Replicant because they already explained the mechanics of how Replicants work in this world and Deckard contradicts too many of the rules, he is too old, too slow, too weak, and it just plain wouldn't make sense for any organization to do this. 

Another one for me is how at the end of The Thing, it's meant to be ambiguous whether or not MacReady or Childs are aliens. However, when I first saw it I assumed that neither of them could be aliens because if MacReady were an alien he'd have attacked Childs, and if Childs was an alien he'd have attacked MacReady as soon as he put down the flamethrower, they wouldn't just both sit down and wait to freeze to death.

What ambiguous endings did you feel didn't work as intended?",3868,2837,movies,0.93,1696341996.0

It’s not something she’s ever taken an interest in but obviously is aware of the series.

For me it's the definition of so bad it's good. Was this done with any self awareness by the director or producers? 

My daughter and I are laughing all the time watching this movie. The bad acting acting, the dialogue, the camera work, the vegetarian vampires. It's all hilarious. Are the sequels all this ridiculous? Should we watch the rest for more laughs?

It won't ever replace Mannequin as my favorite bad movie, but I must say it's comes pretty friggin close.

But my goodness, the action sequences far make up for all its faults.

I'm not going to list why True Lies' action sequences are simply better than most, if not all, modern blockbusters. We all know why: prevalent reliance on CGI, green screen in favor of locations, chopped-to-bits editing, no sense of scale due to the loss of depth thanks to the last two points, and no attempt to build momentum in sequences. I could go on.

But, man, it’s sad that visually, in my opinion, nothing that has been released in the past 20 years comes close to the astonishing achievement Cameron and his team pulled off.

I speak to 2012 when he starred in John Carter, Battleship and Savages. The first debuted in March, the second in May and the last in July. So, in the course of four months he had three flops, two of which were huge flops that killed his leading man career.

> 
> ####The hedge fund billionaire is locked in a nasty behind-the-scenes legal fight over his depiction in the new GameStop movie and has hired at least two separate law firms to send Sony Pictures threatening letters—one of which I obtained.
> 
> I was in Roy Thomson Hall on Friday night here in Toronto for the world premiere of Dumb Money, the very fun Craig Gillespie film about the GameStop meme-stock frenzy of 2021. If you recall, during the height of Covid, retail investors ran up the share prices of GameStop and others, eventually inflicting a “squeeze” on irate institutional investors who had shorted the stocks. As the credits rolled and the audience applauded, I wondered what Ken Griffin—the Wall Street titan, billionaire proprietor of the Citadel hedge fund, and an alleged villain of the GameStop saga—thought of the film. You won’t believe this, but he’s not a fan. 
> 
> Like, really not a fan. I’ve since learned that Griffin is locked in a nasty behind-the-scenes legal fight with Sony Pictures over his depiction in Dumb Money, which is set to begin its theatrical roll-out on Friday. Griffin has hired at least two separate law firms and sent multiple threatening letters, one of which I obtained, and he’s consulting with crisis P.R. people to push back aggressively on his depiction by actor Nick Offerman and the filmmaking team. Griffin claims the movie “crosses the line into the knowingly false and defamatory portrayal of Ken and Citadel Securities,” according to the letter sent to Sony Pictures general counsel Leah Weil by well-known media attorney Tom Clare, who is joined by Quinn Emanuel partner Bill Burck.   
> 
> My first thought was… really? Like I said, I saw the film, and no, the depiction of Griffin certainly isn’t positive—ditto the portrayal of other GameStop players, like Gabe Plotkin (Seth Rogen), whose fund lost billions shorting the troubled game retailer, and Steve Cohen (Vincent D’Onofrio), whose Point72 fund helped prop up Plotkin (and who, of course, is wearing a Mets hat in the film). But to my eye, the sharp script, written by former financial journalists Rebecca Angelo and Lauren Schuker Blum, doesn’t stretch the key facts beyond the widely circulated news headlines about the GameStop frenzy and the S.E.C. investigation, or the source material book, The Antisocial Network, by Ben Mezrich.

16q57g8,Has there ever been a more legally inaccurate film than Double Jeopardy?,"I watched this last night, God Almighty.  I had an idea that they took some liberties with the idea of double jeopardy itself, but it was so much worse than I thought.

It's 25 years old, but massive spoilers abound anyway.

---

A woman is framed by her husband for his murder.  It happens out in the ocean, she's prosecuted by the state of Washington.  That might or might not be accurate depending on how far out the boat was, I guess.

When she's in prison an ex-lawyer inmate tells her that the double jeopardy rule means she could shoot her husband in Times Square and there would be nothing anyone could do about it.  This is the centrepiece of the film, and it's doubly inaccurate, since Times Square is in a different state and it would be a different murder.

She's up for parole for murder after 6 years (???) and confesses to killing her husband.

Immediately after leaving prison she embarks on a crime spree across multiple states, breaking into buildings, resisting arrest, fraud, she destroys several cars, nearly kills her probation officer.

Eventually she catches up with her husband in New Orleans.  With the film having set up that she can murder him in front of a crowd of people, you're expecting her to do that.  Instead she has a catty conversation with him to blackmail him into handing over her son, presumably so she can live a life on the lam with the kid.  This plan fails.  The evil husband bonks her over the head, locks her in a coffin

In the mean time her probation officer has found out that she's actually innocent of the initial murder and the guy is still alive.  Rather than telling the police and exposing that she never committed the crime in the first place, he decides to team up with her.  At this point her plan isn't to kill him, but to frame him for her murder while she goes on the run with her son.  

As a former law professor, the parole officer assures both parties that she can legally kill him with no problem (which she can't).  

After informing him of the plan they turn their backs on him, he pulls out a gun, and she ends up shooting him to stop him murdering the parole officer anyway, which would be perfectly legal regardless of double jeopardy, so the central premise of the film didn't even make any difference!

She's then taken back to Washington where her parole officer assures her he will recommend a full pardon.  She gets it, seemingly instantly, is back in Louisiana in no time and the film ends with her free as a bird.",3516,1029,movies,0.91,1695477436.0

12t773z,"For about two years now i've been trying to watch every cinderella movie ever made, there are hundreds but I wanna tell you about absolute weirdest ones i've seen.","So i have ADHD and one of the symptoms of adhd are intense hyperfixations and cinderella has been my biggest hyperfixation since i was little. It also helps that my homelife is very tumultuous so i am quite attached to her, i even have a cinderella collection. So i decided to make it a hobby of mine to engage with every single cinderella related thing i could find. Movies, games, youtube videos, stage musicals, tv series, comics, whatever it is, i have made it my mission to consume it. I'm basically an expert now. With that being said lots of these movies are weird as fuck, and i would love to share them with you.

1. Cinderella: once upon a time in the west

Starting off with one of the weirdest ones, this Cinderella is an anthropomorphic Elk, not only that, she's also a tough as nails old western cowgirl. Her fairy godmother is an anthropomorphic male goat who's a native american shaman, and it's handled just as stereotypically as you'd imagine. She gets in a bar fight and loses a tooth and that ends up being the glass slipper replacement. Oh, and instead of horses they ride ostriches. This is surprisingly not the first cowgirl cinderella i have ever seen.

2. Cinderfella

Ahhh Jerry Lewis, one of the funniest and most annoying people in film history. He stars in this 1950's genderbend version of cinderella with a very 1950's mentality. The fairy god father in this movie is said to be the original fairy god father from the cinderella tale, and that women lied and erased male history because ""women are like russians, they wanna claim they invented everything"". He is only helping fella so men can confidently snap back at their nagging wives that keep complaining their husbands aren't prince charming, because this will somehow settle the score. This movie is pretty cringe and it's treatment of women only gets worse from there, but even as a very liberal gay woman, i found this movie entertaining for what it was.

3. Year of the fish

Wow! An actually good movie! This movie is a very artsy foreign film with an all asian cast, based on one of the oldest iterations of the cinderella story, before charels perrault came and wrote abour pumpkins and glass slippers. Ye Xian is a very demure and kind 17 year old who has been sent to work at her great aunts brothel under the guise it's a salon. She is forced to be a maid after she refuses to have sex for money and then her uncle sexually harrasses her. This movie has many many hilarious lines you would not expect from a cinderella movie. ""Your momma should of taught you how to suck dick"" ""he likes you to touch his butt hole"", at one point yi xians fairy god mother threatens to cut her tits off. This movie is incredibly fucked up and depressing, and i really respect it for that.

4. Elle: a cinderella story

One of the worst movies i have ever seen is no doubt Elle: a cinderella story, Elle is a wannabe country singer working as an intern at a record label for 3 ungrateful pop stars. The story itself is your rather standard modern cinderella fair but where this movie gets really weird is the characters and dialouge. Elle herself is incredibly snotty and mean, she makes fun of eating disorders and other people with no remorse, and she is never held accountable. This movie is a very poor rip off of the much better movie, another cinderella story, i wouldn't reccomend anyone watch this unless you're very drunk with friends.

5. Rags

What is Keke palmers best preformance? I'm sure some of you would say Nope or any actually good movie but i'm here to tell you that you're aaaaalll wrong! Her best role was in the movie rags, where she plays a knock off beyonce dating a knock off russelbrand and fills the prince's role in this hip hop cinderella story. Charlie prince is just your average pasty white boy who dreams of being a rapper, but his stereotypically new yorker step dad insists he must be a janitor. This movie was aired on nickelodeon and you can tell it really really wanted the success disney channel had with it's ""a cinderella story"" series. I always got this movie confused with let it shine and i'm not really sure how? Anyways there's not much to really say about this movie but it's interesting how Keke plays the prince in this movie and then went on to play Cinderella in the stage version of rogers and hammersteins cinderella.

6. A cinderella story: Star struck

The fourth installment in the epic a cinderella story series, this movie stars Bailee madison, who you might know from the haunting hour or the good witch. She plays finely, a wannabe movie star farmhand but her metrosexual influencer stepfamily look down on her for being southern. She ends up cross dressing tk go to an acting audition and things just get weirder from there. Instead of two step sisters though, Finley has one step sister and a really gay step brother, who even mentions that Finley's cross dressing persona, Huck, might be gay, which is surprisingly progressive for these movies. There's some jokes about tik tok and a really cringey subplot where Finley's step sister is attracted to Huck. It's awful. Although this is surprisingly not the first time there's beenna cross dressing cinderella story.

8. Cinderella (2002)

Yet another absolutely terrible movie, i almost feel bad picking on this cause i suspect it was some kind of passion project. I cannot imagine a studio would actually fund this and think it would make money. Cinderella is named Zezolla in this movie and she is incredibly annoying, bratty, and self righteous. Instead of a god mother we have a mermaid in a cave. 98% of this movie is green screened and Lucy Punch appears in this movie, with this being, no joke, her THIRD time playing an evil step sister in cinderella movies. Iconic. This movie is bad. Do not watch it.

Honestly i could keep going but i suspect anybody who actually bothered to read this far is getting bored. Despite how bad these movies are i am glad i watched them and i respect the people who made them for trying to tell cinderella's story in new, intriguing ways. I love that this story about survival and abuse has so many movies about it, that's incredible.

Sorry if this post was long and weird, I just don't have anybody who cares to listen to me ramble about cinderella movies. I thought that a subreddit that's meant to talk about movies would be a good place to share.",3477,559,movies,0.95,1682008583.0

*Shrek* and *The Princess Bride* both parody the fairytale genre, but are beloved fairytales in their own right. *The Princess Bride* is a favorite of many today, and *Shrek* has spawned a ton of sequels and spin-offs.

*Hot Fuzz* is another example in the buddy cop genre. Blatantly a parody with a lot of meta references to the genre, but then it turns into one of the best buddy cop action sequences in film.

18p9apg,Film critics are really misunderstood on this subreddit but also by people in general,"There's this weird thing that happens every time a blockbuster movie comes out and the critics reviews come out

If the reviews for a blockbuster are negative, redditors will say things like ""these reviews from critics seem really harsh, its a blockbuster, of course its not trying to be some cinematic masterpiece like Citizen Kane or Casablanca""

Or they'll say ""critics are just pretentious, the movie is probably good if you turn your brain off and don't think about it too hard""

But everyone forgets that Face/Off, the Nicolas Cage and John Travolta action movie, received rave reviews from film critics

It has an 82/100 rating on Metacritic from critics reviews and the plot is insanely silly and the epitome of a ""turn your brain off"" action movie

Critics also love Borat, it has an 89/100 Metascore and received critics prizes when it came out

And yet it features a scene where two naked men have a fight where one of them ends up trapped under the other man's ballsack unable to breathe

And yet critics love it

So why do people think critics are not democratic in their movie tastes?

Critics judge every movie against what its attempting and if a movie gets bad reviews, it's probably because critics thought that it wasn't even a good version of what it's attempting to be",3419,998,movies,0.82,1703349035.0

There are movies you watch as a teen and are certain are masterpieces, like it's so original and well executed and resonates so much with you. Then you grow up, try rewatching as an adult, and you just can't stand the cringe that emanates from it, and you can't comprehend why you loved it so much! 

I wondered what were some of those for other people. I enjoy watching cringe from time to time.

The 2nd is a guilty pleasure. It fit so well with my rebel/broody phase as a teen, I actually thought the movie was groundbreaking. Well... I still enjoy watching it, but it's just nostalgia now. I suffer through it xD",3408,4576,movies,0.89,1703206452.0

Recently I just watched Peanut Butter Falcon(Amazing film BTW, Everyone should watch it) and his performance in that film was phenomenon.

Then I also remembered his performances in films like Fury and Lawless, He was actually great in all of them.

16dbbi2,"How bad is the Tomatometer? Here's the top 10 movies of all time according to Rotten Tomatoes, Metacritic, and IMDB. Which list do you prefer?","&#x200B;

A couple things to note, Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic are based on critics reviews, IMDb is based on users reviews. Rotten Tomatoes adjusted score comes from [this article](https://collider.com/top-highest-rated-movies-on-rotten-tomatoes/). The adjusted score is explained by RT as:

>*Each critic from our discrete list gets one vote, weighted equally. A movie must have 40 or more rated reviews to be considered. The Adjusted Score comes from a weighted formula (Bayesian) that we use that accounts for variation in the number of reviews per movie.*

For me personally, IMDb seems to be the most accurate (not just the top 10, but in general as well). What do you think? What's missing, who has the best list?

Edit: I just want to clarify something. I am aware of how the tomatometer works, and that it is a measure of the percentage of positive reviews. The point of this post was to say that maybe that's not a good metric for evaluating movies and that an average score is actually a better metric.

Edit 2: People seem to think the list from the article is boosting newer movies because they have more ratings. This is not what Bayesian weighting is, here is a basic explanation
> The Bayesian average adjusts the average rating of products whose rating counts fall below a threshold. Suppose the threshold amount is calculated to be 100. That means average ratings with less than 100 ratings get adjusted, while average ratings with more than 100 ratings change only very slightly. This threshold amount of 100 is called a confidence number, because it gives you confidence that averages with 100 or more ratings are more reliable than averages with less than 100 ratings.",3303,2088,movies,0.84,1694181410.0

15aazgt,Has Anyone Ever Been Triggered By A Film?,"My father was one of those veterans who *never* spoke about his service — ever. Any questions to him about his time during WWII would be quietly deflected or ignored.

When we buried him at Arlington in 2017, I was finally able to obtain and look at his military records. He had survived both the battle of Leyte Gulf, and the battle of the Coral Sea, with two of his ships sunk out from underneath him and his shipmates. The Battle of Leyte Gulf alone was horrific, with 16,000 US soldiers and 7,200 sailors killed, and 420,000 deaths on the Japanese side. 34 ships went down.

When I was 13 in 1975, I remember begging him to take me to see JAWS. It was the first big summer blockbuster, and of course - all of my friends were gabbing about it.

Anyhow, we went to the film and he walked out of the movie two thirds of the way through. I thought he was in the bathroom, buying popcorn, or having a smoke - but later, I just found him sitting in the car. I think he might have been crying. I quietly asked him why he had left, and his terse answer was ""I didn't like the movie"".

It took me 42 years to figure out that Quint's speech regarding the Indianapolis had really upset him.

On a brighter note - he led a happy life as an English professor almost up until his passing. He loved to teach, and loved his students dearly.

So here's the one that comes to mind for me: Midsommar.

After it ended, I both noticed the theater was notably more empty than it was at the beginning, not that half the audience left or anything, but a noticeable like 10% perhaps....and you could tell the whole theater was just creeped out of their minds. None of the typical post-movie chatter or overhearing people talk about their favorite parts like usually happens....just everyone kind of silently filing out. The only such talk I did hear was a group of like college aged girls who were just saying things like ""that was so fucked up!"", which I think was the entire audience's collective reaction even if not said in words.

The Wrestler was kind of a similar impact, although obviously not for similar reasons, it's a completely different type of movie but I could tell afterwards the entire audience was very much collectively emotionally crushed.

Let's say we have 2 friends who like to have fun and goof around, with regular goals and regular lives, until one of them does something like accidentally cross the wrong person or kill someone. 
Or the main cast is oblivious to the gradual change in their environment like a virus breakout or a serial killer running loose.
Another one would be a film that, after being a comedy for most of its length, turns very dark, such as a group of friends ending up in a war and experiencing the horrors of it, completely played straight. 

Just to clarify, I don't mean a movie that is already set to become dark, but rather a movie that was marketed as a comedy that took an unexpected (or slightly foreshadowed) dark turn.

I have to say the amount of people that were opposed to him were actually kinda justified, despite how he was the protagonist and we're following his lead and feeling sorry for him that he struggles in fulfilling his dreams. He is very irresponsible and careless when it comes to how his actions affect other people.

For example, his best friend; Ned allows him to live in his apartment rent free and takes advantage over the fact he can’t stand up to him in contributing to their unit by fairly splitting their expenses and doesn’t consider Ned’s needs. 

But the real character that’s portrayed as the “antagonist” is Ned’s girlfriend! She actually tries to get Ned to have the courage to tell Dewey he can’t keep paying his share, and just wants him to stop letting him push him around. She really wasn't that much of a ""nightmare"" like Dewey insisted she was, he just couldn't stand the fact that she fearlessly calls him out for not being a grown up and can't accept the reality of his situation. She was quite supportive of Ned, that she put up with Dewey for him, until by the end of the movie Ned chose to support Dewey instead despite how she stood up for him after Dewey almost jeopardizes Ned's career and tried to help him in taking charge better.

Also I think the parents had every right to be angry and unimpressed with how the school just let Dewey (disguising himself as Ned) work at the school, without doing a proper background check on him and immediately took his word on the phone that he was in fact Ned. I know it’s just a movie, but realistically I would think they still would’ve went through some sort of process before granting him the job.",3208,2485,movies,0.92,1691436276.0

My kid knew there was a sequel (as I'd often praised it, without divulging any detail), so the immediate question afterward was, ""When can I watch Terminator 2?!""  Thankfully, kids these days don't talk much about such 'old' movies -- and I've always been tight-lipped about movie plots & details.  I intentionally withhold just about everything I can about any movie we might watch together someday -- and Terminator 2 was no exception.  I'd kept all plot & character details secret.  Those of us who were around when the original movie came out can remember how [the 1991 trailer straight-up spoiled the character details](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRRlbK5w8AE&pp=ygUZdGVybWluYXRvciAyIDE5OTEgdHJhaWxlcg%3D%3D) (as would become tradition for Terminator films, apparently) -- particularly how Arnold was the the good guy this time -- and many other key moments of the film.

And so this week, at long last, we watched Terminator 2 together.  In the first act, we hit two particular scenes I was worried might spoil things:

* First, Arnold's Terminator shows up and wreaks havoc at the bar.  As he exits to the tune of 'Bad to the Bone' this song seems a little out of place to me -- it's a little more 'upbeat' than we'd expect for this terrifying machine we'd just watched remorselessly murder 20-30 people in the previous film.  I take a side glance at the kid, who doesn't seem to be offput by the music and has bought into 'this is the villain, just like before', so we carry on with no comments or questions asked.
* Next, the as-yet-unknown other character, believed to be another resistance fighter like Reese, shows up and moves about in more stealth, and even disguises himself as a police officer -- a guardian.  Clearly my kid has bought into this being the hero/protector.  He rolls up to the foster parents' house to ask about John, and I fear his cover is blown -- because for the first time, I notice the family dog is going bonkers in the background.  Having *just* watched the first film a few days earlier -- where they made a big deal about dogs sensing Terminators -- I thought my kid would pick up on this and  make the connection.  Luckily, our *own* family dog also barks when a stranger is at the door, so this subtle clue was overlooked.  Phew.

So then we get to the mall.  And the hallway.  Guns drawn.  Then Arnold says, ""Get down"" and my kid goes bug-eyed and says, ""....*whaaaaaaat.....?*""  Arnold uses himself as a shield and my kid's eyes get wider.  Then the two characters go toe-to-toe, grappling over the shotgun, and we see this smaller, character dwarfed by Arnold but is *just as strong or stronger* as they bash each other into the walls -- and my kid audibly goes, ""wait, WHAAAAAT IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW???!""

Of course there's no time to fully comprehend what just happened because now it's time for the bike/foot chase, followed immediately by the bike/truck/motorcycle chase ... then the rescue and explosive ending to this incredibly intense action sequence, during which we've watched an apparently indestructible entity (who, moments ago we thought was our hero) nearly murder a child.  My kid, like John Connor, is absolutely mind-boggled.  We desperately need John to call the ""ok, time out, stop the bike, come on, time out, stop the bike"" so we can pause and unpack these revelations.  We're given a moment to breathe, to try and process what we've just witnessed, are given a little on-screen exposition ... my kid's mind is completely blown.

It was absolutely magnificent, and I loved every second of experiencing this through my kid's eyes.  At the same time, I was saddened that this wasn't the experience I -- or almost anyone else in 1991 -- got to have, thanks to that trailer.  **That trailer was an absolute crime against cinema and should never have been made that way**.

Several other parts of the film also landed with great positivity, such as ""Come with me if you want to live"", and ""I'll be back"" -- which, of course, had also been spoiled for the rest of us by the 1991 trailer.

This is a message to anyone else who will soon be introducing this action classic (or most any movie, really) to the next generation:  keep those viewers in the dark.  Let the stories unfold as directed and watch it blow their minds -- and you too can vicariously experience the exhilaration that was blatantly stolen from us in 1991.",3118,516,movies,0.94,1683000376.0

14nocdo,"Adult fans of Big Trouble in Little China, were you also obsessed with this film as a kid? + my autographed photo of Dennis Dun","Big Trouble in Little China is one of my absolute favorite movies of all time, and I was obsessed with this movie as a kid as well. Wondering if anyone else has a lifelong passion for this film. Also thought I’d share that in 1989, when I was 9, I wrote a fan letter to Dennis Dun, the actor who played Wang Chi. He was my favorite character in the movie and I thought he was really really cool. Somehow my dad was able to get the letter to him and he mailed me this high-quality photo with a personalized autograph. I was beyond thrilled when I got it.

Anyway, I think this film is timeless and can appeal to anyone regardless of age. I don't think anyone other than John Carpenter could've made this movie as good as it is. There’s just something about it that is so original and fun. All the characters are fantastic and it’s just a blast. I’d also like to point out that James Hong is so good as Lo Pan. One of the best villains of all time! For people who have loved this film since childhood, what has kept you drawn to this film after so many years?

(""Oh hell, give me the Goddamn soap!"") But that opening sequence with the titular troopers terrorizing the stoner trio is just comedic gold. Not only hysterical and full of memorable lines (""Mother of God.""), but also taps into the universal fear/suspicion that cops don't pull us over on the highway because we do anything wrong, but because they're using us for their amusement...and then taking that to the extreme. Add in Geoffrey Arend eating all those shrooms and spending the rest of the sequence freaking out and it's just a masterpiece of a comedic setpiece. The Broken Lizards arguably have never topped it.

They are also conveniently within walking distance of a Federation outpost, where Scotty, another character from the original series that Spock Prime recognizes, happens to be stationed and he happens to know new untested technology that allows Kirk to teleport onto the Enterprise even while it's in warp.

Edit: just wanna say how satisfying it is to discuss this shit with yall as its been on my mind since forever lol. 

I ALSO think this phenomenon falls into 4 categories:

 1) The actor stands out in a distracting way because they're SO renowned, so good at what they do, and have been in so many iconic films. So it's not even a bad thing truly, it's that they're *that* good at their jobs that their screen presence is just extremely domineering. 

2) They stand out in a distracting way because they've been continuously, horrifically miscast. 

3) They may have found their niche and are good at it, but regardless, they have been fully type-casted into the exact same role/character/persona no matter what. 

3) Whether they're strong or weak performers, they've just been far too overly marketed by their PR team, too many talk shows in one go, and just too ""overly exposed"" as a public persona if anything, so when you *do* see them on screen, that over exposure of their personal lives or ""personalities"" is now too distracting (Jennifer Lawrence, Tom Holland, Zendaya etc)",3035,4865,movies,0.88,1695555351.0
166zsrq,Gyllenhaal in Nightcrawler is the most accurate depiction of a narcissistic sociopath I have ever seen,"This is my first post on this subreddit, forgive me if this isn't the right type of post or formatting on here. I just really wanted to talk about this movie. 

&nbsp;
RANT/THOUGHTS:
Just watched nightcrawler for the first time (I'm late I know). It was amazingly done and was ultimately a terrifying watch. Considering a lot of the prompts I got to watch the movie were in admiration for the MC Lou Bloom, I found myself having to pause several times throughout to ask the people who recommended it ""wtf"" because his character was so true to that of a deeply scary narcissist I was not sure what was admirable about him. While at times the movie feeds the viewers that exact idea with clarity, what impressed me most were the subtleties reinforcing just how f*cked up Lou is.
&nbsp;
It was never a slow descent into madness like the start of the movie might have led you to believe, with a poor man looking to make money to survive. (Although I''m sure not everyone saw it that way since the opening scene with him >!attacking the security guard to steal his watch!< really set the tone for his character) From the way he chose to word his threats, placing implicit blame on his victims- because of course it wasn't his fault, it was theirs (>!RIP Rick!<); to the way that he forced his control over people because A) he could, and B) he felt entitled and justified in doing so. Especially considering he never actually got physical with anybody, or used conventional threats. The entire movie I was left filled with dread because I was waiting for the moment to come where he would snap and kill somebody, and yet it never came- not directly anyway. (this suspense and dread is only further built as the viewers know that he is both capable and willing to resort to that sort of behaviour based on the opening scene) Which again falls in line with his character. By never actually causing direct harm to another, he will never have to grapple with guilt because he didn't do it himself. He just plays puppet master and plays people how he need in order to get the result he wants.
&nbsp;
Additionally, the shot of him >!saying ""I’d like to think if you’re seeing me you’re having the worst day of your life"" then holding back his smug smile while staring directly at the viewer via the security camera!< was masterful and powerful work on the directors part. 
&nbsp;

QUESTIONS:
&nbsp;

- How the hell is Lou not drowning in speeding tickets? I know California is a wild place but come on, are there NO red light cameras in that part of LA or something?.
&nbsp;

- >!HOW DID THE GUYS NOT SEE LOU FOLLOWING THEM? Rick makes a point of saying exactly what I was thinking during the climax of the film as Lou tails the gangsters throughout LA in his bright red challenger with a racing stripe??!< 
&nbsp;

- >!How is Lou's alibi to the detective following the climax of the movie unverifiable, does LA not have any cameras that could have caught and disproven the whole story of Lou being stalked by the gangsters? especially given he says he pulled an evasive maneuver?!< 
&nbsp;

Anyways, please tell me i'm not alone in this or let me know if you think i'm super wrong and that there are better portrayals of NPD. Also if anyone has any recommendations from the same director (Dan Gilroy) because I want to check out more of his work!

1axeijq,Was February 2024 the worst month for movies? An in-depth analysis,"I wanted to go to the movies recently, but when I went to see what was playing all the biggest movies looked terrible.  The Bob Marley biopic, Argylle, Madame Web... truly dismal stuff. And it got me wondering: ***was this the worst slate of top box office movies of all time?***  And so I began digging.

Box Office Mojo has month by month breakdowns of the box office intake of every movie, so I looked at the top 3 grossing movies every month for the past 40 years.  I then looked up those movies' Metacritic scores (shout out to OMDb) and averaged them up to see the best and worst months to see a movie in the last 40 years.

I'll start with the ***best***:

10 (tie). **July 2007** \- Avg. Metascore 76: **Transformers** (61), **Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix** (71), **Ratatouille** (96)

Partner and I rewatched *Judgment Day* last night for fun since it was August 29 and each time I watch the movie, John's age bugs me more and more. Even with Sarah's training and whatnot, I cannot accept that the John character is 10 years old. 13 or 14? An actual teenager? Yes, absolutely, but definitely not a 10-year-old child. Not with the stuff he's done followed by the film's events.

The funny thing is at the beginning of *Rise of the Machines*, John Connor DOES say that he was 13 when he first met a Terminator, but that's just sloppy writing. If that were true, the events of the second movie would be taking place AFTER Judgment Day and that just screws stuff up.

*T2* is still a phenomenal movie and holds up to this day, but I just had to vent a little about that one flaw.

Edit: To clarify since this keeps coming up, I'm not talking about Edward Furlong's age. I am fully aware he wasn't 10 years old when filming the movie. I'm talking about the John Connor character. I don't believe that the CHARACTER is a 10-year-old.",2903,546,movies,0.92,1693412936.0

I kind of hate the director for having made that movie and having made me all stressed out. Yet a part of me feels drawn to it, almost like a gambler is attracted to risking things. There is a kind of sickly pleasure to it. Maybe because I know that feeling. It's a sickly way to really feel alive.

13a05ay,"Léon: The Professional is giving me conflicted thoughts. It’s good, but also really fucking creepy.","I saw it for the first time last night. I’ll start with what I liked.

• The acting performances were fantastic. Jean Reno captures the essence of Léon better than anyone could, Natalie Portman acts well beyond her years, and Gary Oldman’s character is one of the more unique and interesting movie villains I’ve seen. My eyes were glued to the screen whenever he was on screen.  

• The cinematography was great. There were plenty of beautiful shots that I loved. 

• The action sequences were well-shot and enthralling. 

Now, what I didn’t like, and the most prevalent critique of the film: The over-sexualization of a 12-13 year old Natalie Portman.

This was extremely off-putting. There were a couple of times when I paused the film and said aloud to myself “What the fuck.” The scene where Mathilda dresses up as Madonna and Marilyn Monroe is just weird, she calls Léon her “lover” or “my love” multiple times, tells him she has a crush on him, a few camera shots needlessly show off her body, etc. 

Some of this could perhaps be chalked up to a kid having an innocent crush; I get that, but it doesn’t help that the director of the film married and impregnated a minor, and claimed that relationship inspired the movie. Also, the original script apparently had a scene where Mathilda seduces Léon, so WTF.

I want to like the film because there are a lot of great things about it, but this left a bad taste in my mouth. Does anyone else feel this way?",2927,1070,movies,0.82,1683402581.0

It is just a very fun, hilarious and wholesome narrative to watch, with the voice acting being wildly entertaining that it never fails to put me in a good mood. All the voice actors from Dave Foley, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Hayden Panettiere, Denis Leary, Joe Ranft, David Hype Pierce, Bonnie Hunt, etc. were incredible. Slim, Francis and Heimlich were my favourite characters as they had the funniest moments in the film, that part of the scene at the circus where they dressed as flowers and a bee always cracks me up!! 

Hopper was such a great villain (and one of Disney's scariest), as he understands that underestimating your enemies can backfire if you don't use fear to keep them 'in line' and it features my favourite John Ratzenberger appearance from all of the voiceovers he does in Pixar movies. I could tell he had such a blast voicing P.T. Flea in this movie, he invested so much energy in this role compared to his other Pixar voiceovers! 

Also this was the first movie where they started the tradition of creating ""deleted scenes"" before ending it with Monsters Inc. I really miss those deleted scenes they’d make for their movies, just to give the audience more content to enjoy.",2826,424,movies,0.87,1682291616.0

Thankfully, the special features on the Blu-ray explained that it was sort of a forced perspective trick: At the beginning of the scene, the plant is really a few feet behind the flower pot it's supposedly planted in. It is then moved towards the camera during the shot, creating the illusion of it getting bigger while the pot and the wall behind it stay the same. Genius.",2806,1417,movies,0.94,1692059426.0

1ad3ooh,"Hot Take: I Think Barbie is (Intentionally?) a Critique of Rich ""Girlboss"" Feminism","A bit late to the discussion, but only just saw Barbie, and I feel like one message of the movie is a critique of rich (white?) feminism and the need for intersectionality.  As I understand the movie:

1. Barbie world is meant to be a mirror image of the real world.  So whereas women are oppressed by the patriarchy in the real world, Kens are oppressed by the matriarchy in Barbie world (or, if not oppressed, second class citizens).
2. America Ferrara's character, Gloria, has at least some control/impact on Barbie world.  It is her negative thoughts that introduce the fear of mortality into stereotypical Barbie, and I believe she notes that Weird Barbie looks the way she does because Gloria did things to the doll in real life.  It may even be that all of Barbie world is an extension of her psyche and that there are in fact multiple Barbie worlds, each created by a real world girl's imagination (it was unclear to me what the case may be).  But regardless, it would appear that Gloria is at least complicit, if not an active participant, in Ken's oppression in Barbie World.
3. In the real world, Gloria's daughter is in private school (she wears a school uniform), she lives in a multi-million dollar home in Los Angeles, drives a brand new car with all the options, and works on the top floor of a large multinational company as some sort of executive assistant (so not a nothing job), but can only see herself as oppressed because she is not actually in the boardroom (which is true! That is oppression!).
4. There is no discussion of class in the movie (all the Barbies are fabulously wealthy), and while the Barbies are diverse, race is also not mentioned.  In the movie, all oppression is viewed solely thru the lens of patriarchy and feminism, not intersectionally.
5. At no point does Gloria show any awareness of her own role as an oppressor, whether in the real world or of Ken(s) in Barbie world.  In fact, when Ken rebels against the oppression that Gloria was at the very least complicit in, she works against him to restore the status quo.  And while Gloria apologizes to Weird Barbie for making her look weird (I could be misremembering this), she never apologizes to Ken for her actions towards him.

I don't know, I'm not sure Gerwig intended it, but it seems to me that this is a bit of a parody of the strain of girlboss feminism that thinks an oppressive society can be dismantled simply by making more women CEOs.

Or I could have just been way too high when I watched (the colors were pretty though).

&#x200B;

EDIT: I rewatched a couple of scenes, and I was wrong about the private school.  The daughter and friends are just wearing very, very similar outfits, but the students in the background are not in uniforms.  So I may have overstated things a bit.  Still think Gloria is wealthy in a professional class kind of way.  Also, the relationship between Gloria and Weird Barbie is unclear.  Gloria says ""I had a Weird Barbie! It happens when you play too much with them!"" and Weird Barbie says ""It's okay"" and kind of winks.  I took it to mean this was Gloria's Weird Barbie, but it is ambiguous.",2791,888,movies,0.75,1706451667.0

1brypcw,I am not okay after watching A Star Is Born.,"Huge spoilers for the movie obviously.

So I walked into this movie knowing nothing aside from the bare premise. I remember back when it came out that there was a lot of buzz around it, about how great it was and how amazing the performances were. I just never really got around to watching it, it didn't look like my type of movie at all so I just brushed it off.

Last night, I finally watched it. Wow. I was absolutely blown away. This movie was *amazing.* Cooper and Gaga were *perfectly* casted, and their chemistry together was off-the-charts. The songs were so good. The story was so heartfelt...and so heart*breaking*.

Watching Jackson's descent into alcoholism as a means to cope with obvious depression was hard. What made it even harder to watch was the fact that I have *been* there before. The toll it takes on both yourself and the people around you, this film *nailed* that. Then, when things seem at their worst, they seem to start to actually get better. Jackson wants to change, he wants to change for his wife and his love for her is so real and easy to see. He goes to rehab for months, gets out and seems to be staying clean, looks to be actually happy...then that piece of shit manager has to sit down and say some of the cruellest shit imaginable to this guy.

Now up to this point, I thought the manager was a total douchebag *but* I could see where he was coming from on most things. He was trying to do his job, albeit in a dickish manner. This moment, however, was the one that tipped the scales from 'begrudging understanding' to 'full blown hatred' for this guy. 

Jackson's suicide gutted me. Honestly, my jaw was dropped during the entire sequence between him getting out of the truck with his belt all the way to when the end credits rolled. It is *so* rare that I give such a reaction to a movie or a book or a video game or anything. Maybe I'm just being a bitch and I need to toughen up, but wow I am *still* hurting over this movie. I really thought this movie was gonna end on a happy note. I imagined Jackson finally being sober and him and Ally singing a duet of the song that he was writing. Boy, was I wrong. I definitely see what everyone was talking about when they praised this film. Honestly, so glad I watched the new Godzilla and Kong movie today as a palette cleanser lol.

   * Critics Consensus: Visually thrilling and narratively epic, *Dune: Part Two* continues Denis Villeneuve's adaptation of the beloved sci-fi series in spectacular form.

[Deadline](https://deadline.com/2024/02/dune-part-two-review-denis-villeneuve-spectacular-sequel-timothee-chalomet-rebecca-ferguson-1235832727/):

>To be fair to Villeneuve, it was never a given that there’d be a thirst for this franchise in the first place, and audiences went into *Part One* not knowing that they’d want a *Part Two* just as soon as it finished. *Part Two* would be an epic achievement from any other director, but it feels that there is something bigger, better and obviously more *decisive* to come in the third and hopefully final part of the trilogy. “This isn’t over yet!” says Chani, and if anyone can tie up this strange, sprawling story and take it out with a bang, Villeneuve can.

[Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/dune-part-two-review-timothee-chalamet-zendaya-1235830061/):

>Running close to three hours, *Dune: Part Two* moves with a similar nimbleness to Paul and Chani’s sandwalk through the open desert. The narrative is propulsive and relatively easy to follow, Hans Zimmer’s score is enveloping, and Greig Fraser’s cinematography offers breathtaking perspectives that deepen our understanding of the fervently sought-after planet. All these elements make the sequel as much of a cinematic event as the first movie.

[Variety](https://variety.com/2024/film/reviews/dune-2-review-timothee-chalamet-denis-villeneuve-1235917934/) (80/100):

>Villeneuve treats each shot as if it could be a painting. Every design choice seems handed down through millennia of alternative human history, from arcane hieroglyphics to a slew of creative masks and veils meant to conceal the faces of those manipulating the levers of power, nearly all of them women.

[Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-reviews/dune-part-two-review-1234962710/) (90/100):

>The French-Canadian filmmaker has delivered an expansion and a deepening of the world built off of Herbert’s prose, a YA romance blown up to Biblical-epic proportions, a Shakespearean tragedy about power and corruption, and a visually sumptuous second act that makes its impressive, immersive predecessor look like a mere proof-of-concept. Villeneuve has outdone himself.

[The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/dune-2-review-timothee-chalamet-zendaya/) (75/100):

>For those already invested in the “Dune” franchise, “Dune: Part Two” is a sweeping and engaging continuation that will make you eager for a third installment. And if you were a fence-sitter on the first, this should also hold your attention with a taut, well-done script and engaging characters with whom you’ll want to spend nearly three hours.

[IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/dune-part-two-movie-review-1234955419/) (C):

>The pieces on this chess board are so big that we can hardly even tell when they’re moving, and while that sensation helps to articulate the sheer inertia of Paul’s destiny, it also leads to a shrug of an ending that suggests Villeneuve and his protagonist are equally at the mercy of their epic visions. No filmmaker is better equipped to capture the full sweep of this saga (which is why, despite being disappointed twice over, I still can’t help but look forward to “Dune: Messiah”), and — sometimes for better, but usually for worse — no filmmaker is so capable of reflecting how Paul might lose his perspective amid the power and the resources that have been placed at his disposal.

[SlashFilm](https://www.slashfilm.com/1522684/dune-part-two-review/) (7/10):

>Perhaps viewing the first ""Dune"" and ""Dune: Part Two"" back-to-back is the best solution, but I suspect most people aren't going to do that — they're going to see a new movie. And what they'll get is half of one. Maybe that won't matter, though. Perhaps audiences will be so wowed by that final act that they'll come away from ""Dune: Part Two"" appropriately stunned. And maybe whenever Villeneuve returns to this world — and it sure seems like he wants to — he can finally find a way to tell a complete story.

[Inverse](https://www.inverse.com/entertainment/dune-2-review):

>“In so many futures, our enemies prevail. But I do see a way. There is a narrow way through,” Paul tells his mother at one point in the film. Like Paul’s vision of the future, there were many ways for *Dune: Part Two* to fail. But not only does it succeed, it surpasses the mythic tragedy of the first film and turns a complicated, strange sci-fi story into a rousing blockbuster adventure. *Dune: Part Two* isn’t a miracle, per se. But it’s nothing short of miraculous.

[IGN](https://www.ign.com/movies/dune-part-two) (8/10):

>Dune: Part Two expands the legend of Paul Atreides in spectacular fashion, and the war for Arrakis is an arresting, mystical ride at nearly every turn. Denis Villeneuve fully trusts his audience to buy into Dune’s increasingly dense mythology, constructing Part Two as an assault on the senses that succeeds in turning a sprawling saga into an easily digestible, dazzling epic. Though the deep world-building sometimes comes at the cost of fleshing out newer characters, the totality of Dune: Part Two’s transportive power is undeniable.

[The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/dune-part-two-review-zendaya-timothee-chalamet-b2499855.html) (100/100):

>Part Two is as grand as it is intimate, and while Hans Zimmer’s score once again blasts your eardrums into submission, and the theatre seats rumble with every cresting sand worm, it’s the choice moments of silence that really leave their mark.

[Total Film](https://www.gamesradar.com/dune-part-two-review/) (5/5):

>The climax here is sharply judged, sustaining what worked on page while making the outcome more discomforting. It’s a finale that might throw off anyone unfamiliar with Herbert, or anyone expecting conventional pay-offs. But it does answer the story’s themes and, tantalizingly, leave room for more. Could Herbert’s trippy Dune Messiah be adapted next, as teased? Tall order, that. But on the strength of this extravagantly, rigorously realized vision, make no mistake: Villeneuve is the man to see a way through that delirious desert storm.

[Polygon](https://www.polygon.com/e/23842690) (93/100):

>Dune: Part Two is exactly the movie Part One promised it could be, the rare sequel that not only outdoes its predecessor, but improves it in retrospect… One of the best blockbusters of the century so far.

[Screenrant](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/dune-part-two/https//screenrant.com/dune-part-2-movie-review/) (90/100):

>Dune: Part Two is an awe-inspiring, visually stunning sci-fi spectacle and a devastating collision of myth and destiny on a galactic scale.

[RogerEbert.com](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/dune-part-two-movie-review-2024) (88/100):

>Dune: Part Two is a robust piece of filmmaking, a reminder that this kind of broad-scale blockbuster can be done with artistry and flair.

1azwgd6,Are Netflix movies todays straight to video movies? ,"I feel like Netflix and also Amazon churn these films out just as quick as we would get straight to video films. Stick a famous actor on the cover and hope for the best. Only difference is the straight to video films, the actor that was put on the cover usually only stared in a small fraction of the film. Whereas the Netflix films they are usually the star. I get that the studios throw the film onto streaming straight away to make a quick buck and hopefully break even... So back to my original question... Are straight to streaming the new straight to video? ",2738,594,movies,0.86,1708889219.0
16lvvzm,Everyone in Jaws is an alcoholic,"Seriously. Brody, Hooper, and Quint are just pounding drinks throughout the movie. From Brody's wife suggesting they ""get drunk and fool around"", to the awkward wine scene and ensuing sharktopsy, to Quint's famous Indianapolis story on the boat, they're all constantly sloshed. Even when Brody's playing with his kid, he has a stiff glass of whiskey by his side. Pretty sure there was a random shot of Quint chugging a 'gansett. 

This was my first rewatch as an adult. The 70's really do hit different.

EDIT: Hell, even the guy in the opening scene is too drunk to follow the skinny dipper into the water

18lueut,"BASEketball is some of the funniest, dumb American comedy I've ever seen in my life","I've watched it all the way through well over 50 times. I definitely prefer it to Orgazmo. Not being a fan of South Park, I believe it's a version of their humor that is palatable to people like me. The Airplane writer's humor is genius, and it mixes perfectly with theirs. The movie is a dumb parody of sports and jocks. I have no idea why it gets such a bad rap. So many of the jokes and visual gags absolutely kill me every single time I watch it. Trey Parker talking to the kid in the hospital, while the lady is reading him that book ""Women Who Run With The Wolves"". The ""carpet laying"" joke. The ""Do you have any idea how much $ Shaq makes now? ........ The same as he made playing in college?   WHAT???!! No!! WAYYY more!!"" ""Sir, can I borrow your blanket?""  My absolute favorite is the bit about the hairpiece. It's like more Airplane for people who love Airplane

It's the perfect dumb/smart 90's movie. Some of the Stone/Parker written bits can get SUPER dumb, but that's the point. The Airplane writing is genius, the soundtrack is super 90's, the premise is absurd, they have real sportscasters delivering ridiculous lines: ""A team that defied the odds, a team that... blah blah blah"" 90's comedy classic imo",2715,577,movies,0.93,1702964145.0

17d5b6h,The Blob (1988) is one of the most cruel horror movies ever filmed,"In most horror movies I watch, the victim is attacked and killed relatively quickly. The slasher/monster stalks the victim, terrifies them, and inflicts mortal wounds. 

What The Blob (1988) does is differently is that it regularly shows the victims in pure agony as they're slowly killed. 

Very few people in this movie die a quick death. The ones who get smashed or crushed are the lucky ones.

Most of the victims in this movie don't die by being eaten - they die by suffocation. They're being melted alive, fully conscious, for up to minutes at a time. The moment the Blob makes skin contact, they're screaming in pain. When they're trapped inside the Blob, they're trying to scream.

The cruelty in this movie is off-the-charts and it goes beyond the on-screen agony.

Consider the phone-booth scene. Not only do we watch Fran's fate slowly get sealed, we see the Sheriff stuck in the blob, still alive but melting, just to give Fran an idea of what's going to happen to her. These are good people, who just happened to have a wholesome romantic connection earlier in the movie.

Then there's Eddie - the kid in the sewer, arguably the most famous death in the film. Not only does that kid suffer the same horrible, slow death as the others, but his death is book-ended by shots of his helpless big brother. The victims aren't just throw-away characters - Eddie had people who cared about him and big bro is going to be haunted for the rest of his life.

Aside from the villainous government officials and one of the jocks, the people in this movie don't deserve to die - especially in the most horrific way imaginable. ",2737,616,movies,0.92,1697902686.0
